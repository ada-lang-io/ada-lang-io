The declarations Max_Binary_Modulus, Max_Nonbinary_Modulus, Max_Base_Digits, Null_Address, Word_Size, Bit_Order, Default_Bit_Order, Any_Priority, Interrupt_Priority, and Default_Priority are added to System in Ada 95. The presence of ordering operators for type Address is also guaranteed (the existence of these depends on the definition of Address in an Ada 83 implementation). We do not list these as incompatibilities, as the contents of System can vary between implementations anyway; thus a program that depends on the contents of System (by using <strong>use</strong> System; for example) is already at risk of being incompatible when moved between Ada implementations. <br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>The programmer should ensure that the address passed to To_Pointer is either Null_Address, or the address of an object of type Object. (If Object is not a by-reference type, the object ought to be aliased; recall that the Address attribute is not required to provide a useful result for other objects.) Otherwise, the behavior of the program is unspecified; it might raise an exception or crash, for example. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<strong></strong>Unspecified is almost the same thing as erroneous; they both allow arbitrarily bad behavior. We don't say erroneous here, because the implementation might allow the address passed to To_Pointer to point at some memory that just happens to &ldquo;look like&rdquo; an object of type Object. That's not necessarily an error; it's just not portable. However, if the actual type passed to Object is (for example) an array type, the programmer would need to be aware of any dope that the implementation expects to exist, when passing an address that did not come from the Address attribute of an object of type Object.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
One might wonder why To_Pointer and To_Address are any better than unchecked conversions. The answer is that Address does not necessarily have the same representation as an access type. For example, an access value might point at the bounds of an array when an address would point at the first element. Or an access value might be an offset in words from someplace, whereas an address might be an offset in bytes from the beginning of memory. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
For another example, if the implementation has chosen to use negative component offsets (from an access value), it might not be possible to preserve the semantics, since negative offsets from the Address are not allowed. (The Address attribute always points at &ldquo;the first of the storage elements...&rdquo;.) Note that while the implementation knows how to convert an access value into an address, it might not be able to do the reverse. To avoid generic contract model violations, the restriction might have to be detected at run time in some cases. <br /></Admonition>
