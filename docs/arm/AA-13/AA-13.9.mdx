<p>[ An unchecked type conversion can be achieved by a call to an instance of the generic function Unchecked{"_"}Conversion.] <br /></p>


#### Static Semantics

#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>The size of the formal parameter S in an instance of Unchecked{"_"}Conversion is that of its subtype. [This is the actual subtype passed to Source, except when the actual is an unconstrained composite subtype, in which case the subtype is constrained by the bounds or discriminants of the value of the actual expression passed to S.]<br /></p>

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<p>If all of the following are true, the effect of an unchecked conversion is to return the value of an object of the target subtype whose representation is the same as that of the source object S: <br /></p>

<MarginText>6</MarginText>

<li>S'Size = Target'Size. <br /></li>

<MarginText>8</MarginText>
<li>The target subtype is not an unconstrained composite subtype.<br /></li>
<MarginText>9</MarginText>
<li>S and the target subtype both have a contiguous representation.<br /></li>

</ul>
<MarginText>11/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00426-01"]} />
<p>Otherwise, if the result type is scalar, the result of the function is implementation defined, and can have an invalid representation (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-13/AA-13.9#Subclause_13.9.1">13.9.1</a>). If the result type is nonscalar, the effect is implementation defined; in particular, the result can be abnormal (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-13/AA-13.9#Subclause_13.9.1">13.9.1</a>).<br /></p>

## 13.9.1  Data Validity

<MarginText>1_13.9.1</MarginText>
<p>Certain actions that can potentially lead to erroneous execution are not directly erroneous, but instead can cause objects to become <i>abnormal</i>. Subsequent uses of abnormal objects can be erroneous.<br /></p>

<MarginText>2_13.9.1</MarginText>
<p>A scalar object can have an <i>invalid representation</i>, which means that the object's representation does not represent any value of the object's subtype. The primary cause of invalid representations is uninitialized variables.<br /></p>

<MarginText>3_13.9.1</MarginText>
<p>Abnormal objects and invalid representations are explained in this subclause. <br /></p>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>4_13.9.1</MarginText>
<p>When an object is first created, and any explicit or default initializations have been performed, the object and all of its parts are in the <i>normal</i> state. Subsequent operations generally leave them normal. However, an object or part of an object can become <i>abnormal</i> in the following ways: <br /></p>

<MarginText>5_13.9.1</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>An assignment to the object is disrupted due to an abort (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.8">9.8</a>) or due to the failure of a language-defined check (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-11/AA-11.6">11.6</a>).<br /></li>
<MarginText>6/2_13.9.1</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00426-01"]} />
<li>The object is not scalar, and is passed to an <b>in out</b> or <b>out</b> parameter of an imported procedure, the Read procedure of an instance of Sequential{"_"}IO, Direct{"_"}IO, or Storage{"_"}IO, or the stream attribute T'Read, if after return from the procedure the representation of the parameter does not represent a value of the parameter's subtype.<br /></li>
<MarginText>6.1/2_13.9.1</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00426-01"]} />
<li>The object is the return object of a function call of a nonscalar type, and the function is an imported function, an instance of Unchecked{"_"}Conversion, or the stream attribute T'Input, if after return from the function the representation of the return object does not represent a value of the function's subtype.<br /></li>

The reason we allow composite objects to become abnormal is that such object might be represented with implicit levels of indirection; if those are corrupted, then even assigning into a component of the object, or simply asking for its Address, might have an unpredictable effect.

#### Bounded (Run-Time) Errors

<MarginText>9_13.9.1</MarginText>
<p>If the representation of a scalar object does not represent a value of the object's subtype (perhaps because the object was not initialized), the object is said to have an <i>invalid representation</i>. It is a bounded error to evaluate the value of such an object. If the error is detected, either Constraint{"_"}Error or Program{"_"}Error is raised. Otherwise, execution continues using the invalid representation. The rules of the language outside this subclause assume that all objects have valid representations.

In such cases, the implementation ought to define the semantics of operations on the invalid representations in the obvious manner (assuming the bounded error is not detected): a given representation should be equal to itself, a representation that is in between the internal codes of two enumeration literals should behave accordingly when passed to comparison operators and membership tests, etc. We considered <i>requiring</i> such sensible behavior, but it resulted in too much arcane verbiage, and since implementations have little incentive to behave irrationally, such verbiage is not important to have.<br />

## 13.9.2  The Valid Attribute

<dt><br/>X'Valid</dt>

<dl>
<dd>Yields True if and only if the object denoted by X is normal, has a valid representation, and then, if the preceding conditions hold, the value of X also satisfies the predicates of the nominal subtype of X. The value of this attribute is of the predefined type Boolean. <br /></dd>

<b></b>Valid is defined only for scalar objects because the implementation and description burden would be too high for other types. For example, given a typical run-time model, it is impossible to check the validity of an access value. The same applies to composite types implemented with internal pointers. One can check the validity of a composite object by checking the validity of each of its scalar subcomponents. The user should ensure that any composite types that need to be checked for validity are represented in a way that does not involve implementation-defined components, or gaps between components. Furthermore, such types should not contain access subcomponents.<br />
