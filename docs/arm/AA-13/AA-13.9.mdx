#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>The size of the formal parameter S in an instance of Unchecked_Conversion is that of its subtype. [This is the actual subtype passed to Source, except when the actual is an unconstrained composite subtype, in which case the subtype is constrained by the bounds or discriminants of the value of the actual expression passed to S.]<br /></p>

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<p>If all of the following are true, the effect of an unchecked conversion is to return the value of an object of the target subtype whose representation is the same as that of the source object S: <br /></p>

<p>Otherwise, if the result type is scalar, the result of the function is implementation defined, and can have an invalid representation (see <a href="../AA-13/AA-13.9#Subclause_13.9.1">13.9.1</a>). If the result type is nonscalar, the effect is implementation defined; in particular, the result can be abnormal (see <a href="../AA-13/AA-13.9#Subclause_13.9.1">13.9.1</a>).<br /></p>

## 13.9.1  Data Validity

<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>Certain actions that can potentially lead to erroneous execution are not directly erroneous, but instead can cause objects to become <em>abnormal</em>. Subsequent uses of abnormal objects can be erroneous.<br /></p>

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>A scalar object can have an <em>invalid representation</em>, which means that the object's representation does not represent any value of the object's subtype. The primary cause of invalid representations is uninitialized variables.<br /></p>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>Abnormal objects and invalid representations are explained in this subclause. <br /></p>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>When an object is first created, and any explicit or default initializations have been performed, the object and all of its parts are in the <em>normal</em> state. Subsequent operations generally leave them normal. However, an object or part of an object can become <em>abnormal</em> in the following ways: <br /></p>

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>An assignment to the object is disrupted due to an abort (see <a href="../AA-9/AA-9.8">9.8</a>) or due to the failure of a language-defined check (see <a href="../AA-11/AA-11.6">11.6</a>).<br /></li>
<MarginText>6/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00426-01"]} />
<li>The object is not scalar, and is passed to an <strong>in out</strong> or <strong>out</strong> parameter of an imported procedure, the Read procedure of an instance of Sequential_IO, Direct_IO, or Storage_IO, or the stream attribute T'Read, if after return from the procedure the representation of the parameter does not represent a value of the parameter's subtype.<br /></li>
<MarginText>6.1/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00426-01"]} />
<li>The object is the return object of a function call of a nonscalar type, and the function is an imported function, an instance of Unchecked_Conversion, or the stream attribute T'Input, if after return from the function the representation of the return object does not represent a value of the function's subtype.<br /></li>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
We did not include Stream_IO.Read in the list above. A Stream_Element should include all possible bit patterns, and thus it cannot be invalid. Therefore, the parameter will always represent a value of its subtype.

<p>Whether or not an object actually becomes abnormal in these cases is not specified. An abnormal object becomes normal again upon successful completion of an assignment to the object as a whole. <br /></p>

<MarginText>8</MarginText>
<p>It is erroneous to evaluate a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0141">primary</a></code> that is a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> denoting an abnormal object, or to evaluate a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> that denotes an abnormal object. <br /></p>

<MarginText>8.c/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00114-01"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<strong></strong>The reason we allow access objects, and objects containing subcomponents of an access type, to become abnormal is because the correctness of an access value cannot necessarily be determined merely by looking at the bits of the object. The reason we allow scalar objects to become abnormal is that we wish to allow the compiler to optimize assuming that the value of a scalar object belongs to the object's subtype, if the compiler can prove that the object is initialized with a value that belongs to the subtype. The reason we allow composite objects to become abnormal is that such object might be represented with implicit levels of indirection; if those are corrupted, then even assigning into a component of the object, or simply asking for its Address, might have an unpredictable effect. The same is true if the discriminants have been destroyed. <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>


#### Bounded (Run-Time) Errors

<MarginText>9</MarginText>
<p>If the representation of a scalar object does not represent a value of the object's subtype (perhaps because the object was not initialized), the object is said to have an <em>invalid representation</em>. It is a bounded error to evaluate the value of such an object. If the error is detected, either Constraint_Error or Program_Error is raised. Otherwise, execution continues using the invalid representation. The rules of the language outside this subclause assume that all objects have valid representations. The semantics of operations on invalid representations are as follows:<br /></p>

Array indexing must not cause memory outside of the array to be written (and usually, not read either).

If such a result object is used as the source of an assignment, and the assigned value is an invalid representation for the target of the assignment, then any use of the target object prior to a further assignment to the target object, other than as the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> of a Valid attribute reference, is erroneous. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>In a typical implementation, every bit pattern that fits in an object of a signed integer subtype will represent a value of the type, if not of the subtype. However, for an enumeration or floating point type, as well as some modular types, there are typically bit patterns that do not represent any value of the type. In such cases, the implementation ought to define the semantics of operations on the invalid representations in the obvious manner (assuming the bounded error is not detected): a given representation should be equal to itself, a representation that is in between the internal codes of two enumeration literals should behave accordingly when passed to comparison operators and membership tests, etc. We considered <em>requiring</em> such sensible behavior, but it resulted in too much arcane verbiage, and since implementations have little incentive to behave irrationally, such verbiage is not important to have.<br /></Admonition>

## 13.9.2  The Valid Attribute

<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>The Valid attribute can be used to check the validity of data produced by unchecked conversion, input, interface to foreign languages, and the like. <br /></p>


#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>For a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> X that denotes a scalar object [(after any implicit dereference)], the following attribute is defined: <br /></p>

<MarginText>3/4</MarginText>
<dt><br/>X'Valid</dt>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0153-3", "AI12-0071-1"]} />
<dl>
<dd>Yields True if and only if the object denoted by X is normal, has a valid representation, and then, if the preceding conditions hold, the value of X also satisfies the predicates of the nominal subtype of X. The value of this attribute is of the predefined type Boolean. <br /></dd>

<MarginText>3.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<strong></strong>Having checked that X'Valid is True, it is safe to read the value of X without fear of erroneous execution caused by abnormality, or a bounded error caused by an invalid representation. Such a read will produce a value in the subtype of X. <br /></Admonition>

NOTE 2   Determining whether X is normal and has a valid representation as part of the evaluation of X'Valid is not considered to include an evaluation of X; hence, it is not an error to check the validity of an object that is invalid or abnormal. Determining whether X satisfies the predicates of its nominal subtype can  include an evaluation of X, but only after it has been determined that X has a valid representation.<br /></Admonition>

NOTE 3   The Valid attribute can  be used to check the result of calling an instance of Unchecked_Conversion (or any other operation that can return invalid values). However, an exception handler is still useful  because implementations are permitted to raise Constraint_Error or Program_Error if they detect the use of an invalid representation (see <a href="../AA-13/AA-13.9#Subclause_13.9.1">13.9.1</a>).<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>14.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<strong></strong>Valid is defined only for scalar objects because the implementation and description burden would be too high for other types. For example, given a typical run-time model, it is impossible to check the validity of an access value. The same applies to composite types implemented with internal pointers. One can check the validity of a composite object by checking the validity of each of its scalar subcomponents. The user should ensure that any composite types that need to be checked for validity are represented in a way that does not involve implementation-defined components, or gaps between components. Furthermore, such types should not contain access subcomponents.<br /></Admonition>
