<p>[ Each access-to-object type has an associated storage pool. The storage allocated by an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code> comes from the pool; instances of Unchecked_Deallocation return storage to the pool. Several access types can share the same pool.]<br /></p>

<MarginText>2/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00435-01"]} />
<p>[A storage pool is a variable of a type in the class rooted at Root_Storage_Pool, which is an abstract limited controlled type. By default, the implementation chooses a <em>standard storage pool</em> for each access-to-object type. The user may define new pool types, and may override the choice of pool for an access-to-object type by specifying Storage_Pool for the type.] <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>2.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<strong></strong>By default, the implementation might choose to have a single global storage pool, which is used (by default) by all access types, which might mean that storage is reclaimed automatically only upon partition completion. Alternatively, it might choose to create a new pool at each accessibility level, which might mean that storage is reclaimed for an access type when leaving the appropriate scope. Other schemes are possible. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry">
<strong></strong>Each access-to-object type has an associated storage pool object. The storage for an object created by an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code> comes from the storage pool of the type of the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code>.

#### Legality Rules

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>If Storage_Pool is specified for a given access type, Storage_Size shall not be specified for it. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<strong></strong>The Storage_Pool determines the Storage_Size; hence it would not make sense to specify both. Note that this rule is simplified by the fact that the aspects in question cannot be specified for derived types, nor for nonfirst subtypes, so we don't have to worry about whether, say, Storage_Pool on a derived type overrides Storage_Size on the parent type. For the same reason, &ldquo;specified&rdquo; means the same thing as &ldquo;directly specified&rdquo; here. <br /></Admonition>

#### Erroneous Execution

<p>If Storage_Pool is specified for an access type, then if Allocate can satisfy the request, it should allocate a contiguous block of memory, and return the address of the first storage element in Storage_Address.

The allocated storage should not be used for any other purpose while the pool element remains in existence. If the request cannot be satisfied, then Allocate should propagate an exception [(such as Storage_Error)]. If Allocate behaves in any other manner, then the program execution is erroneous. <br /></p>

#### Legality Rules

<MarginText>3.1/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0157-1"]} />
<p>A call on an instance of Unchecked_Deallocation is illegal if the actual access type of the instance is a type for which the Storage_Size has been specified by a static expression with value zero or is defined by the language to be zero. In addition to the places where Legality Rules normally apply (see <a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3">12.3</a>), this rule applies also in the private part of an instance of a generic unit.<br /></p>

<strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Defined a "dangling reference", and specified that a dangling reference might designate some other existing object. This allows simple implementations of access values and reuse of object memory after deallocation. In prior versions of Ada, "=" between a dangling reference and an access to an existing object has to return False, even if the existing object and the object designated by the dangling reference are allocated in the same memory. A program that depended upon that could break with this revised rule. However, as a practical matter, almost all Ada implementations use simple implementations of access types that do not meet that requirement. So such a program would not work (consistently) on most Ada implementations; thus the change shouldn't break any existing programs - it just aligns the Standard with actual practice.<br /></Admonition>

<p>A <em>subpool</em> is a separately reclaimable portion of a storage pool, identified by an object of type Subpool_Handle (a <em>subpool handle</em>). A subpool handle also identifies the enclosing storage pool, a <em>storage pool that supports subpools</em>, which is a storage pool whose type is descended from Root_Storage_Pool_With_Subpools. A subpool is created by calling Create_Subpool or a similar constructor; the constructor returns the subpool handle.<br /></p>

<p>If a storage pool that supports subpools is specified as the Storage_Pool for an access type, the access type is called a <em>subpool access type</em>. A subpool access type shall be a pool-specific access type.<br /></p>

If the specified storage pool object is a storage pool that supports subpools, then the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> that denotes the object shall not denote part of a formal parameter, nor shall it denote part of a dereference of a value of a non-library-level general access type. In addition to the places where Legality Rules normally apply (see <a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3">12.3</a>), these rules also apply in the private part of an instance of a generic unit. <br /></p>

<p>When an access type with a specified storage pool is frozen (see <a href="../AA-13/AA-13.14">13.14</a>), if the tag of the storage pool object identifies a storage pool that supports subpools, the following checks are made:<br /></p>

<MarginText>25/3</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> used to specify the storage pool object does not denote part of a formal parameter nor part of a dereference of a value of a non-library-level general access type; and<br /></li>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
<strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Added missing wording to state that the objects cease to exist after the completion of finalization. This is formally an inconsistency (it would be possible to depend on the fact that objects finalized by Unchecked_Deallocate_Subpool still exist), but that violates every sane expectation for a procedure called "Deallocate" something.<br /></Admonition>

Clarified that the steps of deallocating a subpool occur in a specific order. This shouldn't change any implementation; no implementation is going to finalize deallocated objects or implement Unchecked_Deallocate_Subpool so it is certain to raise Constraint_Error. <br /></Admonition>
