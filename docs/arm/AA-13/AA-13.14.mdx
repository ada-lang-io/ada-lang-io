<p>[This subclause defines a place in the program text where each declared entity becomes &ldquo;frozen&rdquo;. A use of an entity, such as a reference to it by name, or (for a type) an expression of the type, causes freezing of the entity in some contexts, as described below. The Legality Rules forbid certain kinds of uses of an entity in the region of text where it is frozen.] <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The compile-time purpose of the freezing rules comes from the fact that the evaluation of static expressions depends on overload resolution, and overload resolution sometimes depends on the value of a static expression. (The dependence of static evaluation upon overload resolution is obvious. The dependence in the other direction is more subtle. There are three rules that require static expressions in contexts that can appear in declarative places: The expression in an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0101">attribute_designator</a></code> shall be static. In a record aggregate, variant-controlling discriminants shall be static. In an array aggregate with more than one named association, the choices shall be static. The compiler needs to know the value of these expressions in order to perform overload resolution and legality checking.) We wish to allow a compiler to evaluate static expressions when it sees them in a single pass over the <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0286">compilation_unit</a></code>. The freezing rules ensure that.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The run-time purpose of the freezing rules is called the &ldquo;linear elaboration model&rdquo;. This means that declarations are elaborated in the order in which they appear in the program text, and later elaborations can depend on the results of earlier ones. The elaboration of the declarations of certain entities requires run-time information about the implementation details of other entities. The freezing rules ensure that this information has been calculated by the time it is used. For example, suppose the initial value of a constant is the result of a function call that takes a parameter of type <em>T</em>. In order to pass that parameter, the size of type <em>T</em> has to be known. If <em>T</em> is composite, that size might be known only at run time.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Similar issues arise for incomplete types. However, we do not use freezing to prevent premature access; incomplete types have different, more severe, restrictions. Similar issues also arise for subprograms, protected operations, tasks and generic units. However, we do not use freezing to prevent premature access for those, either; <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11">3.11</a> prevents problems with run-time Elaboration_Checks. Even so, freezing is used for these entities to prevent giving representation items too late (that is, after uses that require representation information, such as calls). <br /></Admonition>

An evaluable construct should freeze anything that's needed to evaluate it.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.l</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
However, if the construct is not evaluated where it appears, let it cause freezing later, when it is evaluated. This is the case for <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code>s and <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.6#S0339">default_name</a></code>s. (Formal parameters, generic formal parameters, and components can have <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code>s or <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.6#S0339">default_name</a></code>s.)<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.m</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The compiler should be allowed to evaluate static expressions without knowledge of their context. (I.e. there should not be any special rules for static expressions that happen to occur in a context that requires a static expression.)<br /></Admonition>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.n</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Compilers should be allowed to evaluate static expressions (and record the results) using the run-time representation of the type. For example, suppose Color'Pos(Red) = 1, but the internal code for Red is 37. If the value of a static expression is Red, some compilers might store 1 in their symbol table, and other compilers might store 37. Either compiler design should be feasible.<br /></Admonition>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.o</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Compilers should never be required to detect erroneousness or exceptions at compile time (although it's very nice if they do). This implies that we should not require code-generation for a nonstatic expression of type <em>T</em> too early, even if we can prove that that expression will be erroneous, or will raise an exception.<br /></Admonition>

Thunk generation cannot, in general, be done at the place of the declaration that includes the default. Instead, they can be generated at the first freezing point of the type(s) involved. (It is impossible to write a purely one-pass Ada compiler, for various reasons. This is one of them &mdash; the compiler needs to store a representation of defaults in its symbol table, and then walk that representation later, no earlier than the first freezing point.)<br /></Admonition>

In implementation terms, the linear elaboration model can be thought of as preventing uninitialized dope. For example, the implementation might generate dope to contain the size of a private type. This dope is initialized at the place where the type becomes completely defined. It cannot be initialized earlier, because of the order-of-elaboration rules. The freezing rules prevent elaboration of earlier declarations from accessing the size dope for a private type before it is initialized.<br /></Admonition>

This is important for the usability of generics. The above example uses the Ada 95 feature of formal derived types. Examples using the kinds of formal parameters already allowed in Ada 83 are well known. See, for example, comments 83-00627 and 83-00688. The extensive use expected for formal derived types makes this issue even more compelling than described by those comments. Unfortunately, we are unable to solve the problem that <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0318">explicit_generic_actual_parameter</a></code>s cause freezing, even though a package equivalent to the instance would not cause freezing. This is primarily because such an equivalent package would have its body in the body of the containing program unit, whereas an instance has its body right there. <br /></Admonition>

#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

</AnnotatedOnly>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>20.h</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The concept of freezing is based on Ada 83's concept of &ldquo;forcing occurrences&rdquo;. The first freezing point of an entity corresponds roughly to the place of the first forcing occurrence, in Ada 83 terms. The reason for changing the terminology is that the new rules do not refer to any particular &ldquo;occurrence&rdquo; of a name of an entity. Instead, we refer to &ldquo;uses&rdquo; of an entity, which are sometimes implicit.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>20.i</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
In Ada 83, forcing occurrences were used only in rules about <code>representation_clause</code>s. We have expanded the concept to cover private types, because the rules stated in RM83-7.4.1(4) are almost identical to the forcing occurrence rules.<br /></Admonition>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>20.j</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The Ada 83 rules are changed in Ada 95 for the following reasons: <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>20.k</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>The Ada 83 rules do not work right for subtype-specific aspects. In an earlier version of Ada 9X, we considered allowing representation items to apply to subtypes other than the first subtype. This was part of the reason for changing the Ada 83 rules. However, now that we have dropped that functionality, we still need the rules to be different from the Ada 83 rules.<br /></li>
<MarginText>20.l</MarginText>
<li>The Ada 83 rules do not achieve the intended effect. In Ada 83, either with or without the AIs, it is possible to force the compiler to generate code that references uninitialized dope, or force it to detect erroneousness and exception raising at compile time.<br /></li>
<MarginText>20.m</MarginText>
<li>It was a goal of Ada 83 to avoid uninitialized access values. However, in the case of deferred constants, this goal was not achieved.<br /></li>
<MarginText>20.n</MarginText>
<li>The Ada 83 rules are not only too weak &mdash; they are also too strong. They allow loopholes (as described above), but they also prevent certain kinds of <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code>s that are harmless, and certain kinds of <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.1#S0310">generic_declaration</a></code>s that are both harmless and very useful.<br /></li>
<MarginText>20.o/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00114-01"]} />
<li>Ada 83 had a case where an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0343">aspect_clause</a></code> had a strong effect on the semantics of the program &mdash; 'Small. This caused certain semantic anomalies. There are more cases in Ada 95, because the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code> has been generalized. <br /></li>
