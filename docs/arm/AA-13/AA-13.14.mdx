<p>[This subclause defines a place in the program text where each declared entity becomes &ldquo;frozen&rdquo;. A use of an entity, such as a reference to it by name, or (for a type) an expression of the type, causes freezing of the entity in some contexts, as described below. The Legality Rules forbid certain kinds of uses of an entity in the region of text where it is frozen.] <br /></p>

<MarginText>1.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>This concept has two purposes: a compile-time one and a run-time one.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The compile-time purpose of the freezing rules comes from the fact that the evaluation of static expressions depends on overload resolution, and overload resolution sometimes depends on the value of a static expression. (The dependence of static evaluation upon overload resolution is obvious. The dependence in the other direction is more subtle. There are three rules that require static expressions in contexts that can appear in declarative places: The expression in an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0101">attribute_designator</a></code> shall be static. In a record aggregate, variant-controlling discriminants shall be static. In an array aggregate with more than one named association, the choices shall be static. The compiler needs to know the value of these expressions in order to perform overload resolution and legality checking.) We wish to allow a compiler to evaluate static expressions when it sees them in a single pass over the <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0286">compilation_unit</a></code>. The freezing rules ensure that.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.c</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The run-time purpose of the freezing rules is called the &ldquo;linear elaboration model&rdquo;. This means that declarations are elaborated in the order in which they appear in the program text, and later elaborations can depend on the results of earlier ones. The elaboration of the declarations of certain entities requires run-time information about the implementation details of other entities. The freezing rules ensure that this information has been calculated by the time it is used. For example, suppose the initial value of a constant is the result of a function call that takes a parameter of type <em>T</em>. In order to pass that parameter, the size of type <em>T</em> has to be known. If <em>T</em> is composite, that size might be known only at run time.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.d</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
(Note that in these discussions, words like &ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after&rdquo; generally refer to places in the program text, as opposed to times at run time.) <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.e</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>The &ldquo;implementation details&rdquo; we're talking about above are: <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.f</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>For a tagged type, the implementations of all the primitive subprograms of the type &mdash; that is (in the canonical implementation model), the contents of the type descriptor, which contains pointers to the code for each primitive subprogram.<br /></li>
<MarginText>1.g</MarginText>
<li>For a type, the full type declaration of any parts (including the type itself) that are private.<br /></li>
<MarginText>1.h</MarginText>
<li>For a deferred constant, the full constant declaration, which gives the constant's value. (Since this information necessarily comes after the constant's type and subtype are fully known, there's no need to worry about its type or subtype.)<br /></li>
<MarginText>1.i</MarginText>
<li>For any entity, representation information specified by the user via representation items. Most representation items are for types or subtypes; however, various other kinds of entities, such as objects and subprograms, are possible. <br /></li>
</ul>
<MarginText>1.j/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0005-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Similar issues arise for incomplete types. However, we do not use freezing to prevent premature access; incomplete types have different, more severe, restrictions. Similar issues also arise for subprograms, protected operations, tasks and generic units. However, we do not use freezing to prevent premature access for those, either; <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11">3.11</a> prevents problems with run-time Elaboration_Checks. Even so, freezing is used for these entities to prevent giving representation items too late (that is, after uses that require representation information, such as calls). <br /></Admonition>


#### Language Design Principles

<MarginText>1.k</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
An evaluable construct should freeze anything that's needed to evaluate it.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.l</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
However, if the construct is not evaluated where it appears, let it cause freezing later, when it is evaluated. This is the case for <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code>s and <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.6#S0339">default_name</a></code>s. (Formal parameters, generic formal parameters, and components can have <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code>s or <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.6#S0339">default_name</a></code>s.)<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.m</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The compiler should be allowed to evaluate static expressions without knowledge of their context. (I.e. there should not be any special rules for static expressions that happen to occur in a context that requires a static expression.)<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.n</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Compilers should be allowed to evaluate static expressions (and record the results) using the run-time representation of the type. For example, suppose Color'Pos(Red) = 1, but the internal code for Red is 37. If the value of a static expression is Red, some compilers might store 1 in their symbol table, and other compilers might store 37. Either compiler design should be feasible.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.o</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Compilers should never be required to detect erroneousness or exceptions at compile time (although it's very nice if they do). This implies that we should not require code-generation for a nonstatic expression of type <em>T</em> too early, even if we can prove that that expression will be erroneous, or will raise an exception.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.p</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Here's an example (modified from AI83-00039, Example 3): <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.q</MarginText>
<CodeBlock language="ada">
type T is{"\n"}    record{"\n"}        ...{"\n"}    end record;{"\n"}function F return T;{"\n"}function G(X : T) return Boolean;{"\n"}Y : Boolean := G(F); -- doesn't force T in Ada 83{"\n"}for T use{"\n"}    record{"\n"}        ...{"\n"}    end record;{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<MarginText>1.r</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
AI83-00039 says this is legal. Of course, it raises Program_Error because the function bodies aren't elaborated yet. A one-pass compiler has to generate code for an expression of type T before it knows the representation of T. Here's a similar example, which AI83-00039 also says is legal: <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.s</MarginText>
<CodeBlock language="ada">
package P is{"\n"}    type T is private;{"\n"}    function F return T;{"\n"}    function G(X : T) return Boolean;{"\n"}    Y : Boolean := G(F); -- doesn't force T in Ada 83{"\n"}private{"\n"}    type T is{"\n"}        record{"\n"}            ...{"\n"}        end record;{"\n"}end P;{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<MarginText>1.t</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
If T's size were dynamic, that size would be stored in some compiler-generated dope; this dope would be initialized at the place of the full type declaration. However, the generated code for the function calls would most likely allocate a temp of the size specified by the dope <em>before</em> checking for Program_Error. That dope would contain uninitialized junk, resulting in disaster. To avoid doing that, the compiler would have to determine, at compile time, that the expression will raise Program_Error.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.u</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
This is silly. If we're going to require compilers to detect the exception at compile time, we might as well formulate the rule as a legality rule.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.v</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Compilers should not be required to generate code to load the value of a variable before the address of the variable has been determined.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>1.w</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
After an entity has been frozen, no further requirements may be placed on its representation (such as by a representation item or a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code>). <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>The <em>freezing</em> of an entity occurs at one or more places (<em>freezing points</em>) in the program text where the representation for the entity has to be fully determined. Each entity is frozen from its first freezing point to the end of the program text (given the ordering of compilation units defined in <a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#Subclause_10.1.4">10.1.4</a>). <br /></p>

<MarginText>2.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>The &ldquo;representation&rdquo; for a subprogram includes its calling convention and means for referencing the subprogram body, either a &ldquo;link-name&rdquo; or specified address. It does not include the code for the subprogram body itself, nor its address if a link-name is used to reference the body. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>2.1/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0019-1", "AI05-0299-1"]} />
<p>This subclause also defines a place in the program text where the profile of each declared callable entity becomes <em>frozen</em>. A use of a callable entity causes freezing of its profile in some contexts, as described below. At the place where the profile of a callable entity becomes frozen, the entity itself becomes frozen.<br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0014</em>{"}"} The end of a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.4#S0254">protected_body</a></code>, or a declaration of a library package or generic library package, causes <em>freezing</em> of each entity and profile declared within it, as well as the entity itself in the case of the declaration of a library unit . A noninstance <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0090">proper_body</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0297">body_stub</a></code>, or <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.5#S0260">entry_body</a></code> causes freezing of each entity and profile declared before it within the same <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code> . <br /></p>

<MarginText>3.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>This is worded carefully to handle nested packages and private types. Entities declared in a nested <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.1#S0230">package_specification</a></code> will be frozen by some containing construct.<br /></Admonition>

An incomplete type declared in the private part of a library <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.1#S0230">package_specification</a></code> can be completed in the body.

<MarginText>3.d/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0300-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>The reason bodies cause freezing is because we want <code>proper_bodies</code> and <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0297">body_stub</a></code>s to be interchangeable &mdash; one should be able to move a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0090">proper_body</a></code> to a <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0302">subunit</a></code>, and vice  versa, without changing the semantics. Clearly, anything that should cause freezing should do so even if it's inside a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0090">proper_body</a></code>. However, if we make it a <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0297">body_stub</a></code>, then the compiler can't see that thing that should cause freezing. So we make <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0297">body_stub</a></code>s cause freezing, just in case they contain something that should cause freezing. But that means we need to do the same for <code>proper_bodies</code>.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>3.e</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Another reason for bodies to cause freezing, there could be an added implementation burden if an entity declared in an enclosing <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code> is frozen within a nested body, since some compilers look at bodies after looking at the containing <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code>.<br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0046</em>{"}"} A construct that (explicitly or implicitly) references an entity can cause the <em>freezing</em> of the entity, as defined by subsequent paragraphs.

In addition, if a parameter of the instantiation is defaulted, the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.6#S0339">default_name</a></code> for that parameter causes freezing.<br /></li>

<p>The tag (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.9">3.9</a>) of a tagged type T is created at the point where T is frozen. <br /></p>


#### Incompatibilities With Ada 83

<MarginText>20.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
RM83 defines a forcing occurrence of a type as follows: &ldquo;A forcing occurrence is any occurrence [of the name of the type, subtypes of the type, or types or subtypes with subcomponents of the type] other than in a type or subtype declaration, a subprogram specification, an entry declaration, a deferred constant declaration, a <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code>, or a <code>representation_clause</code> for the type itself. In any case, an occurrence within an expression is always forcing.&rdquo;<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>20.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
It seems like the wording allows things like this: <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>20.c</MarginText>
<CodeBlock language="ada">
type A is array(Integer range 1..10) of Boolean;{"\n"}subtype S is Integer range A'Range;{"\n"}    -- not forcing for A{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<MarginText>20.d</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Occurrences within <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code>s can cause freezing in Ada 95. (Since such <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code>s are ignored in Ada 83, this will probably fix more bugs than it causes.) <br /></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 83

<MarginText>20.e</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
In Ada 95, <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.1#S0314">generic_formal_parameter_declaration</a></code>s do not normally freeze the entities from which they are defined. For example: <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>20.f</MarginText>
<CodeBlock language="ada">
package Outer is{"\n"}    type T is tagged limited private;{"\n"}    generic{"\n"}        type T2 is{"\n"}            new T with private; -- Does not freeze T{"\n"}                                -- in Ada 95.{"\n"}    package Inner is{"\n"}        ...{"\n"}    end Inner;{"\n"}private{"\n"}    type T is ...;{"\n"}end Outer;{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<MarginText>20.g</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
This is important for the usability of generics. The above example uses the Ada 95 feature of formal derived types. Examples using the kinds of formal parameters already allowed in Ada 83 are well known. See, for example, comments 83-00627 and 83-00688. The extensive use expected for formal derived types makes this issue even more compelling than described by those comments. Unfortunately, we are unable to solve the problem that <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0318">explicit_generic_actual_parameter</a></code>s cause freezing, even though a package equivalent to the instance would not cause freezing. This is primarily because such an equivalent package would have its body in the body of the containing program unit, whereas an instance has its body right there. <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<MarginText>20.h</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The concept of freezing is based on Ada 83's concept of &ldquo;forcing occurrences&rdquo;. The first freezing point of an entity corresponds roughly to the place of the first forcing occurrence, in Ada 83 terms. The reason for changing the terminology is that the new rules do not refer to any particular &ldquo;occurrence&rdquo; of a name of an entity. Instead, we refer to &ldquo;uses&rdquo; of an entity, which are sometimes implicit.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>20.i</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
In Ada 83, forcing occurrences were used only in rules about <code>representation_clause</code>s. We have expanded the concept to cover private types, because the rules stated in RM83-7.4.1(4) are almost identical to the forcing occurrence rules.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>20.j</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The Ada 83 rules are changed in Ada 95 for the following reasons: <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>20.k</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>The Ada 83 rules do not work right for subtype-specific aspects. In an earlier version of Ada 9X, we considered allowing representation items to apply to subtypes other than the first subtype. This was part of the reason for changing the Ada 83 rules. However, now that we have dropped that functionality, we still need the rules to be different from the Ada 83 rules.<br /></li>
<MarginText>20.l</MarginText>
<li>The Ada 83 rules do not achieve the intended effect. In Ada 83, either with or without the AIs, it is possible to force the compiler to generate code that references uninitialized dope, or force it to detect erroneousness and exception raising at compile time.<br /></li>
<MarginText>20.m</MarginText>
<li>It was a goal of Ada 83 to avoid uninitialized access values. However, in the case of deferred constants, this goal was not achieved.<br /></li>
<MarginText>20.n</MarginText>
<li>The Ada 83 rules are not only too weak &mdash; they are also too strong. They allow loopholes (as described above), but they also prevent certain kinds of <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code>s that are harmless, and certain kinds of <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.1#S0310">generic_declaration</a></code>s that are both harmless and very useful.<br /></li>
<MarginText>20.o/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00114-01"]} />
<li>Ada 83 had a case where an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0343">aspect_clause</a></code> had a strong effect on the semantics of the program &mdash; 'Small. This caused certain semantic anomalies. There are more cases in Ada 95, because the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code> has been generalized. <br /></li>
</ul>

#### Incompatibilities With Ada 95

<MarginText>20.p/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00106-01", "AI95-00341-01"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>8652/0046</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Various freezing rules were added to fix holes in the rules. Most importantly, implicit calls are now freezing, which make some representation clauses illegal in Ada 2005 that were legal (but dubious) in Ada 95. <strong>Amendment </strong> Similarly, the primitive subprograms of a specific tagged type are frozen when the type is frozen, preventing dubious convention changes (and address clauses) after the freezing point. In both cases, the code is dubious and the workaround is easy. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0103-1", "AI12-0132-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Clarified when and what an <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.8#S0228">expression_function_declaration</a></code> that is a completion or that is the target of a renames-as-body freezes. This is formally an incompatibility, but as all known implementations freeze expression functions more aggressively than allowed by either the old or new wording, practically this will be an extension.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0168-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0155-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<strong></strong> Clarified that incomplete types do not freeze in any case. The one known case where incomplete freezing was necessary has been plugged with a new Legality Rules (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#Subclause_3.10.1">3.10.1</a>). This matches the original intent (see Language Design Principles above) and eliminates whack-a-mole trying to allow such freezing without it having (almost) any effects.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>20.bb/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0186-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<strong></strong> Clarified that the subtype names in an access type are not frozen at the point of the type declaration. This has always been true (there is an Ada 95-era AARM note that says so) but it didn't follow from the actual wording. Since the ACATS requires the AARM note to be true, no compiler could actually get this wrong, so no incompatibility is possible.<br /></Admonition>
