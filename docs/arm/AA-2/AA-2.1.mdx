The character pair CARRIAGE RETURN/LINE FEED (code points 16#0D# 16#0A#) signifies a single end of line (see <a href="../AA-2/AA-2.2">2.2</a>); every other occurrence of a <code>format_effector</code> other than the character whose code point position is 16#09# (CHARACTER TABULATION) also signifies a single end of line.<br /></p>

<strong></strong>This is simply requiring that an Ada implementation be able to directly process the ACATS, which is provided in the described format. Note that files that only contain characters with code points in the first 128 (which is the majority of the ACATS) are represented in the same way in both UTF-8 and in "plain" string format. The ACATS includes a BOM in files that have any characters with code points greater than 127. Note that the BOM contains characters not legal in Ada source code, so an implementation can use that to automatically distinguish between files formatted as plain Latin-1 strings and UTF-8 with BOM.<br /></Admonition>

Program text can use most characters defined by ISO-10646:2003. This subclause has been rewritten to use the categories defined in that Standard. This should ease programming in languages other than English. <br /></Admonition>

An implementation is allowed (but not required) to use a newer character set standard to determine the categories, case mapping, and case folding. Doing so will change the results of attributes '[[Wide_]Wide_]Image and the packages [Wide_]Wide_Characters.Handling in the case of a few rarely used characters. (This also could make some identifiers illegal, for characters that are no longer classified as letters.) This is unlikely to be a problem in practice. Moreover, truly portable Ada 2012 programs should avoid using in these contexts any characters that would have different classifications in any character set standards issued since 10646:2003 (since the compiler can use any such standard as the basis for its classifications). <br /></Admonition>

A standard source representation is defined that all compilers are expected to process. Since this is the same format as the ACATS, it seems unlikely that there are any implementations that don't meet this requirement. Moreover, other representations are still permitted, and the "impossible or impractical" loophole (see <a href="../AA-1/AA-1.1#Subclause_1.1.3">1.1.3</a>) can be invoked for any implementations that cannot directly process the ACATS. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction">
<strong></strong> The interpretation of Ada source that is in Normalization Form C but not in Normalization Form KC is no longer implementation-defined. This change could potentially change the meaning of a program for a compiler that normalized all program source to Normalization Form KC before processing it. We don't document this as an inconsistency as such handling was previously implementation defined (so any such code was already defined to be not portable), and we're not aware of any compiler that normalized source code (so we don't expect to see this problem in the real world). <br /></Admonition>
