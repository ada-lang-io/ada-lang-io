<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>[This Annex defines facilities for supporting the implementation of distributed systems using multiple partitions working cooperatively as part of a single Ada program.] <br /></p>

#### Extensions to Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
This Annex is new to Ada 95. <br />

#### Post-Compilation Rules

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>A <i>distributed system</i> is an interconnection of one or more <i>processing nodes</i> (a system resource that has both computational and storage capabilities), and zero or more <i>storage nodes</i> (a system resource that has only storage capabilities, with the storage addressable by one or more processing nodes).<br /></p>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>A <i>distributed program</i> comprises one or more partitions that execute independently (except when they communicate) in a distributed system.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>The process of mapping the partitions of a program to the nodes in a distributed system is called <i>configuring the partitions of the program</i>. <br /></p>


#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<p>The implementation shall provide means for explicitly assigning library units to a partition and for the configuring and execution of a program consisting of multiple partitions on a distributed system; the means are implementation defined. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>5.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-defined">
<b></b>The means for creating and executing distributed programs.<br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>


#### Implementation Permissions

<MarginText>6</MarginText>
<p>An implementation may require that the set of processing nodes of a distributed system be homogeneous.<br /></p>

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0440-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
NOTE 1   The partitions comprising a program can be executed on differently configured distributed systems or on a nondistributed system without requiring recompilation. A distributed program can be partitioned differently from the same set of library units without recompilation. The resulting execution is semantically equivalent.<br />

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
NOTE 2   A distributed program retains the same type safety as the equivalent single partition program.<br />
