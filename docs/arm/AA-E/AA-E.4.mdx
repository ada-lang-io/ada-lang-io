<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0359-1"]} />
<p>A <em>remote subprogram call</em> is a subprogram call that invokes the execution of a subprogram in another (active) partition. The partition that originates the remote subprogram call is the <em>calling partition</em>, and the partition that executes the corresponding subprogram body is the <em>called partition</em>. Some remote procedure calls are allowed to return prior to the completion of subprogram execution. These are called <em>asynchronous remote procedure calls</em>.<br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.a/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0359-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<strong></strong>Remote subprogram calls are always between active partitions; a passive partition has no execution resources of its own and thus cannot execute anything, while a remote subprogram call is always executed by the called partition. <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>There are three different ways of performing a remote subprogram call: <br /></p>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>As a direct call on a (remote) subprogram explicitly declared in a remote call interface;<br /></li>
<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<li>As an indirect call through a value of a remote access-to-subprogram type;<br /></li>
<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<li>As a dispatching call with a controlling operand designated by a value of a remote access-to-class-wide type. <br /></li>
</ul>
<MarginText>6</MarginText>
<p>The first way of calling corresponds to a <em>static</em> binding between the calling and the called partition. The latter two ways correspond to a <em>dynamic</em> binding between the calling and the called partition.<br /></p>

<MarginText>7/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0101-1"]} />
<p>Remote types library units (see <a href="../AA-E/AA-E.2#Subclause_E.2.2">E.2.2</a>) and remote call interface library units (see <a href="../AA-E/AA-E.2#Subclause_E.2.3">E.2.3</a>) define the remote subprograms or remote access types used for remote subprogram calls. <br /></p>


#### Language Design Principles

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>7.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Remote subprogram calls are standardized since the RPC paradigm is widely-used, and establishing an interface to it in the annex will increase the portability and reusability of distributed programs.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>


#### Legality Rules

<MarginText>8</MarginText>
<p>In a dispatching call with two or more controlling operands, if one controlling operand is designated by a value of a remote access-to-class-wide type, then all shall be.<br /></p>

<MarginText>8.1/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0283-1"]} />
<p>A nonblocking program unit shall not contain, other than within nested units with Nonblocking specified as statically False, a dispatching call with a controlling operand designated by a value of a remote access-to-class-wide type.<br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>8.a/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<strong></strong>Such a dispatching call is a potentially blocking call (see below) even if the called subprogram is nonblocking, so we must not assert that no blocking is possible. <br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>The calls is illegal if the Nonblocking aspect of the containing unit is True, either implicitly by inheritance or by explicit specification. <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>9</MarginText>
<p>For the execution of a remote subprogram call, subprogram parameters (and later the results, if any) are passed using a stream-oriented representation (see <a href="../AA-13/AA-13.13#Subclause_13.13.1">13.13.1</a>) [which is suitable for transmission between partitions]. This action is called <em>marshalling</em>. <em>Unmarshalling</em> is the reverse action of reconstructing the parameters or results from the stream-oriented representation. [Marshalling is performed initially as part of the remote subprogram call in the calling partition; unmarshalling is done in the called partition. After the remote subprogram completes, marshalling is performed in the called partition, and finally unmarshalling is done in the calling partition.]<br /></p>

<MarginText>10</MarginText>
<p>A <em>calling stub</em> is the sequence of code that replaces the subprogram body of a remotely called subprogram in the calling partition. A <em>receiving stub</em> is the sequence of code (the &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo;) that receives a remote subprogram call on the called partition and invokes the appropriate subprogram body. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>10.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<strong></strong>The use of the term <em>stub</em> in this annex should not be confused with <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0297">body_stub</a></code> as defined in <a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#Subclause_10.1.3">10.1.3</a>. The term <em>stub</em> is used here because it is a commonly understood term when talking about the RPC paradigm. <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>11</MarginText>
<p>Remote subprogram calls are executed at most once, that is, if the subprogram call returns normally, then the called subprogram's body was executed exactly once.<br /></p>

<MarginText>12</MarginText>
<p>The task executing a remote subprogram call blocks until the subprogram in the called partition returns, unless the call is asynchronous. For an asynchronous remote procedure call, the calling task can become ready before the procedure in the called partition returns.<br /></p>

<MarginText>13</MarginText>
<p>If a construct containing a remote call is aborted, the remote subprogram call is <em>cancelled</em>. Whether the execution of the remote subprogram is immediately aborted as a result of the cancellation is implementation defined. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>Whether the execution of the remote subprogram is immediately aborted as a result of cancellation.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>14</MarginText>
<p>If a remote subprogram call is received by a called partition before the partition has completed its elaboration, the call is kept pending until the called partition completes its elaboration (unless the call is cancelled by the calling partition prior to that).<br /></p>

<MarginText>15</MarginText>
<p>If an exception is propagated by a remotely called subprogram, and the call is not an asynchronous call, the corresponding exception is reraised at the point of the remote subprogram call. For an asynchronous call, if the remote procedure call returns prior to the completion of the remotely called subprogram, any exception is lost.<br /></p>

<MarginText>16</MarginText>
<p>The exception Communication_Error (see <a href="../AA-E/AA-E.5">E.5</a>) is raised if a remote call cannot be completed due to difficulties in communicating with the called partition.<br /></p>

<MarginText>17/5</MarginText>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<strong></strong>The example does not show the case where tapes are removed from or added to the system. In the former case, an appropriate exception needs to be defined to instruct the client to use another tape. In the latter, the Name_Server should have a query function visible to the clients to inform them about the availability of the tapes in the system. <br /></Admonition>

<ul>
<li>The package Tapes provides the necessary declarations of the type and its primitive operations.<br /></li>
<MarginText>10</MarginText>
<li>Name_Server is a remote call interface package and is elaborated in a separate active partition to provide the necessary naming services (such as Register and Find) to the entire distributed program through remote subprogram calls.<br /></li>
<MarginText>11</MarginText>
<li>Tape_Driver is a normal package that is elaborated in a partition configured on the processing node that is connected to the tape device(s). The abstract operations are overridden to support the locally declared tape devices (Tape1, Tape2). The package is not visible to its clients, but it exports the tape devices (as remote objects) through the services of the Name_Server. This allows for tape devices to be dynamically added, removed or replaced without requiring the modification of the clients' code.<br /></li>
<MarginText>12/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0442-1"]} />
<li>The Tape_Client procedure references only declarations in the Tapes and Name_Server packages. Before using a tape for the first time, it will  query the Name_Server for a system-wide identity for that tape. From then on, it can use that identity to access the tape device.<br /></li>
<MarginText>13</MarginText>
<li>Values of remote access type Tape_Ptr include the necessary information to complete the remote dispatching operations that result from dereferencing the controlling operands T1 and T2.<br /></li>
