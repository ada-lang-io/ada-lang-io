<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>8652/0078</em>{"}"} When this aspect is False (or not used), it is presumed that most implementations will not make calls through the PCS if the call originates in the same partition as that of the RCI unit. When this aspect is True, all indirect or dispatching remote subprogram calls to the RCI unit, and all direct calls from outside the subsystem rooted at the RCI unit, are treated like calls from outside the partition, ensuring that the PCS is involved in all such calls (for debugging, redundancy, etc.). <br /></Admonition>

<strong>Amendment </strong> The wording was changed from &ldquo;user-specified&rdquo; to &ldquo;available&rdquo; read and write attributes. (This was then further changed, see below.) This means that a type with the attributes specified in the private part would originally have been allowed as a formal parameter of an RCI subprogram, but that is no longer allowed. This change was made so that the rules were consistent with the rules introduced for the Corrigendum for stream attributes; moreover, legality should not depend on the contents of the private part. <br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong> Added a rule to ensure that function results are streamable; this was missing in previous versions of Ada.

<strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Redefined when indirect and dispatching remote calls have to be remote for a unit for which the aspect All_Calls_Remote is True. With the new rules, a local target called indirectly or via dispatching will be routed through the PCS, while that was not necessarily true in earlier Ada. If a program depended on local targets not being routed through the PCS even when All_Calls_Remote is used, then it might behave differently or fail in  Ada 2012 as corrected with this refinement. This is highly unlikely as the PCS is going to be able to communicate with any partition of the program, including the local partition. <br /></Admonition>
