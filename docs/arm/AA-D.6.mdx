# D.6  Preemptive Abort

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} [This subclause specifies requirements on the immediacy with which an aborted construct is completed.] </p>

#### Dynamic Semantics

<p>On a system with a single processor, an aborted construct is completed immediately at the first point that is outside the execution of an abort-deferred operation.</p>

#### Documentation Requirements

<p>On a multiprocessor, the implementation shall document any conditions that cause the completion of an aborted construct to be delayed later than what is specified for a single processor. </p>
<p><em>This paragraph was deleted.</em></p>
<p><strong>Documentation Requirement: </strong>On a multiprocessor, any conditions that cause the completion of an aborted construct to be delayed later than what is specified for a single processor.</p>

#### Metrics

<p>The implementation shall document the following metrics: </p>
<p>The execution time, in processor clock cycles, that it takes for an <code><a href="./AA-9.8#S0284">abort_statement</a></code> to cause the completion of the aborted task. This is measured in a situation where a task T2 preempts task T1 and aborts T1. T1 does not have any finalization code. T2 shall verify that T1 has terminated, by means of the Terminated attribute.</p>
<p>On a multiprocessor, an upper bound in seconds, on the time that the completion of an aborted task can be delayed beyond the point that it is required for a single processor.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00114-01"}</em>{"}"} An upper bound on the execution time of an <code><a href="./AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code>, in processor clock cycles. This is measured between a point immediately before a task T1 executes a protected operation Pr.Set that makes the <code><a href="./AA-4.5#S0150">condition</a></code> of an <code><a href="./AA-9.5#S0262">entry_barrier</a></code> Pr.Wait True, and the point where task T2 resumes execution immediately after an entry call to Pr.Wait in an <code><a href="./AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code>. T1 preempts T2 while T2 is executing the abortable part, and then blocks itself so that T2 can execute. The execution time of T1 is measured separately, and subtracted.</p>
<p>An upper bound on the execution time of an <code><a href="./AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code>, in the case that no asynchronous transfer of control takes place. This is measured between a point immediately before a task executes the <code><a href="./AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code> with a nonnull abortable part, and the point where the task continues execution immediately after it. The execution time of the abortable part is subtracted. </p>
<p><strong>Documentation Requirement: </strong>The metrics for aborts.</p>

#### Implementation Advice

<p>Even though the <code><a href="./AA-9.8#S0284">abort_statement</a></code> is included in the list of potentially blocking operations (see 9.5.1), it is recommended that this statement be implemented in a way that never requires the task executing the <code><a href="./AA-9.8#S0284">abort_statement</a></code> to block.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Advice: </strong>The <code><a href="./AA-9.8#S0284">abort_statement</a></code> should not require the task executing the statement to block.</p>
<p>On a multi-processor, the delay associated with aborting a task on another processor should be bounded; the implementation should use periodic polling, if necessary, to achieve this.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Advice: </strong>On a multi-processor, the delay associated with aborting a task on another processor should be bounded.</p>
<p>NOTE 1   Abortion does not change the active or base priority of the aborted task.</p>
<p>NOTE 2   Abortion cannot be more immediate than is allowed by the rules for deferral of abortion during finalization and in protected actions.</p>
