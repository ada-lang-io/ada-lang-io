<p>[ This Annex contains descriptions of features of the language whose functionality is largely redundant with other features defined by this Reference Manual. Use of these features is not recommended in newly written programs. Use of these features can be prevented by using pragma Restrictions (No{"_"}Obsolescent{"_"}Features), see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-13/AA-13.12#Subclause_13.12.1">13.12.1</a>.] <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<b></b>These features are still part of the language, and have to be implemented by conforming implementations. The primary reason for putting these descriptions here is to get redundant features out of the way of most readers. The designers of the next version of Ada will have to assess whether or not it makes sense to drop these features from the language. <br />
