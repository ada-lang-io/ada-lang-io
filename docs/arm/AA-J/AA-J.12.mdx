#### Syntax

<MarginText>1/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00284-02"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00284-02"}</em>{"}"} <br />In addition to an identifier, the reserved word <strong>interface</strong> is allowed as a pragma name, to provide compatibility with a prior edition of this Reference Manual. <br /></p>

<MarginText>1.a/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00284-02"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00284-02"}</em>{"}"} <br />All implementations need to at least recognize and ignore this pragma. A syntax error is not an acceptable implementation of this pragma. <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<MarginText>1.b/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00326-01", "AI05-0299-1"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />This subclause is new. This is necessary as <strong>interface</strong> is now a reserved word, which would prevent pragma Interface from being an implementation-defined pragma. We don't define any semantics for this pragma, as we expect that implementations will continue to use whatever they currently implement - requiring any changes would be counter-productive. <br /></Admonition>
