#### Syntax

<MarginText>1/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00284-02"]} />
<p class="Indented2">In addition to an identifier, the reserved word <strong>interface</strong> is allowed as a pragma name, to provide compatibility with a prior edition of this Reference Manual. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.a/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00284-02"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note">
<strong></strong>All implementations need to at least recognize and ignore this pragma. A syntax error is not an acceptable implementation of this pragma. <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

</AnnotatedOnly>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.b/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00326-01", "AI05-0299-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
This subclause is new. This is necessary as <strong>interface</strong> is now a reserved word, which would prevent pragma Interface from being an implementation-defined pragma. We don't define any semantics for this pragma, as we expect that implementations will continue to use whatever they currently implement - requiring any changes would be counter-productive. <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>
