<p>The following declaration exists in the declaration of package Standard: <br /></p>

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<CodeBlock language="ada">
Numeric{"_"}Error : exception renames Constraint{"_"}Error;{"\n"}

<MarginText>2.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<b></b>In Ada 83, it was unclear which situations should raise Numeric{"_"}Error, and which should raise Constraint{"_"}Error. The permissions of RM83-11.6 could often be used to allow the implementation to raise Constraint{"_"}Error in a situation where one would normally expect Numeric{"_"}Error. To avoid this confusion, all situations that raise Numeric{"_"}Error in Ada 83 are changed to raise Constraint{"_"}Error in Ada 95. Numeric{"_"}Error is changed to be a renaming of Constraint{"_"}Error to avoid most of the upward compatibilities associated with this change.<br />

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
In new code, Constraint{"_"}Error should be used instead of Numeric{"_"}Error. <br />
