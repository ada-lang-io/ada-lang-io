#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>1/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00326-01"]} />
<p>For the first subtype S of a type <i>T</i> declared by an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.10#S0085">incomplete_type_declaration</a></code> that is not tagged, the following attribute is defined: <br /></p>

<MarginText>2/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00326-01"]} />
<dt><br/>S'Class </dt>
<dl>
<dd>Denotes the first subtype of the incomplete class-wide type rooted at <i>T</i>. The completion of <i>T</i> shall declare a tagged type. Such an attribute reference shall occur in the same library unit as the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.10#S0085">incomplete_type_declaration</a></code>. <br /></dd>
</dl>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>2.a/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00326-01"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<b></b>This must occur in the same unit to prevent children from imposing requirements on their ancestor library units for deferred incomplete types. <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>

#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

</AnnotatedOnly>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>2.b/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00326-01", "AI05-0299-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
This subclause is new. This feature was moved here because the tagged incomplete type provides a better way to provide this capability (it doesn't put requirements on the completion based on uses that could be anywhere). Pity we didn't think of it in 1994. <br />
