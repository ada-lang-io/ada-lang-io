<p>If two different objects, including nonoverlapping parts of the same object, are <em>independently addressable</em>, they can be manipulated concurrently by two different logical threads of control  without synchronization, unless both are subcomponents of the same full access object, and either is nonatomic (see <a href="../AA-C/AA-C.6">C.6</a>). Any two nonoverlapping objects are independently addressable if either object is specified as independently addressable (see <a href="../AA-C/AA-C.6">C.6</a>). Otherwise, two nonoverlapping objects are independently addressable except when they are both parts of a composite object for which a nonconfirming value is specified for any of the following representation aspects: (record) Layout, Component_Size, Pack, Atomic, or Convention; in this case it is unspecified whether the parts are independently addressable. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>Independent addressability is the only high level semantic effect of aspect Pack. If two objects are independently addressable, the implementation should allocate them in such a way that each can be written by the hardware without writing the other. For example, unless the user asks for it, it is generally not feasible to choose a bit-packed representation on a machine without an atomic bit field insertion instruction, because there might be tasks that update neighboring subcomponents concurrently, and locking operations on all subcomponents is generally not a good idea.<br /></Admonition>

In Ada 95, this situation represents a potential nonportability, and a friendly compiler might want to warn the programmer about the situation, but it is not considered an error.

Similarly, two calls are considered to potentially conflict if they each have Global (or Global'Class in the case of a dispatching call) aspects such that conflicting actions would be possible during the execution of the calls.

<p>When the conflict check policy Known_Parallel_Conflict_Checks or All_Parallel_Conflict_Checks applies, the implementation may disallow two concurrent actions appearing within parallel constructs if the implementation can prove they will at run-time denote the same object with uses that conflict. Similarly, when the conflict check policy Known_Tasking_Conflict_Checks or All_Tasking_Conflict_Checks applies, the implementation may disallow two concurrent actions, at least one of which appears within a task body but not within a parallel construct, if the implementation can prove they will at run-time denote the same object with uses that conflict.<br /></p>
