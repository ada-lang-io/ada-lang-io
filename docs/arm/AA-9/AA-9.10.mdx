Any two nonoverlapping objects are independently addressable if either object is specified as independently addressable (see <a href="../AA-C/AA-C.6">C.6</a>). Otherwise, two nonoverlapping objects are independently addressable except when they are both parts of a composite object for which a nonconfirming value is specified for any of the following representation aspects: (record) Layout, Component_Size, Pack, Atomic, or Convention; in this case it is unspecified whether the parts are independently addressable. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Independent addressability is the only high level semantic effect of aspect Pack. If two objects are independently addressable, the implementation should allocate them in such a way that each can be written by the hardware without writing the other. For example, unless the user asks for it, it is generally not feasible to choose a bit-packed representation on a machine without an atomic bit field insertion instruction, because there might be tasks that update neighboring subcomponents concurrently, and locking operations on all subcomponents is generally not a good idea.<br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>The underlying principle here is that for one action to &ldquo;signal&rdquo; a second, the second action has to follow a potentially blocking operation, whose blocking is dependent on the first action in some way.

<MarginText>9.c</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>The point of this distinction is so that on multiprocessors with inconsistent caches, the caches only need to be refreshed at the beginning of an entry body, and forced out at the end of an entry body or protected procedure that leaves an entry open. Protected function calls, and protected subprogram calls for entryless protected objects do not require full cache consistency. Entryless protected objects are intended to be treated roughly like atomic objects &mdash; each operation is indivisible with respect to other operations (unless both are reads), but such operations cannot be used to synchronize access to other nonvolatile shared variables. <br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>Note that if two assignments to the same variable are sequential, but neither signals the other, then the program is not erroneous, but it is not specified which assignment ultimately prevails. Such a situation usually corresponds to a programming mistake, but in some (rare) cases, the order makes no difference, and for this reason this situation is not considered erroneous nor even a bounded error. In Ada 83, this was considered an &ldquo;incorrect order dependence&rdquo; if the &ldquo;effect&rdquo; of the program was affected, but &ldquo;effect&rdquo; was never fully defined. In Ada 95, this situation represents a potential nonportability, and a friendly compiler might want to warn the programmer about the situation, but it is not considered an error. An example where this would come up would be in gathering statistics as part of referencing some information, where the assignments associated with statistics gathering don't need to be ordered since they are just accumulating aggregate counts, sums, products, etc. <br /></Admonition>

Similarly, two calls are considered to potentially conflict if they each have Global (or Global'Class in the case of a dispatching call) aspects such that conflicting actions would be possible during the execution of the calls.

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>To properly synchronize two actions to prevent concurrency, a task that does an update of a <em>non</em>volatile object must use signaling via a synchronized object to indicate it has completed its update, and the other task needs to be signaled by this action on the synchronized object before it reads the updated nonvolatile object. In other words, to synchronize communication via a nonvolatile object, signaling must be used. To synchronize communication via a volatile object, an update of a shared synchronized object followed by a read of the synchronized object in the other task can be sufficient. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0344-1"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0344-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />For a subprogram, the following language-defined representation aspect may be specified:<br /></p>

<dt><br/>Parallel_Calls</dt>
<dl>
<dd>The Parallel_Calls aspect is of type Boolean. The specified value shall be static. The Parallel_Calls aspect of an inherited primitive subprogram is True if Parallel_Calls is True either for the corresponding subprogram of the progenitor type or for any other inherited subprogram that it overrides. If not specified or inherited as True, the Parallel_Calls aspect of a subprogram is False.<br /></dd>
<MarginText>25/5</MarginText>
<dd>Specifying the Parallel_Calls aspect to be True for a subprogram indicates that the subprogram can be safely called in parallel. Conflict checks (if required by the Conflict_Check_Policy in effect) are made on the subprogram assuming that multiple concurrent calls exist.[ Such checks can then be omitted on a call of the subprogram in a parallel iteration context.]<br /></dd>
