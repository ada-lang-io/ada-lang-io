#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>The execution of a task of a given task type consists of the execution of the corresponding <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.1#S0248">task_body</a></code>. The initial part of this execution is called the <i>activation</i> of the task; it consists of the elaboration of the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code> of the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.1#S0248">task_body</a></code>. Should an exception be propagated by the elaboration of its <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code>, the activation of the task is defined to have <i>failed</i>, and it becomes a completed task.<br /></p>

<MarginText>2/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00416-01"]} />
<p>A task object (which represents one task) can be a part of a stand-alone object, of an object created by an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code>, or of an anonymous object of a limited type, or a coextension of one of these. All tasks that are part or coextensions of any of the stand-alone objects created by the elaboration of <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.3#S0032">object{"_"}declaration</a></code>s (or <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-12/AA-12.3#S0317">generic_association</a></code>s of formal objects of mode <b>in</b>) of a single declarative region are activated together. All tasks that are part or coextensions of a single object that is not a stand-alone object are activated together. <br /></p>

For example, the default expression for a subcomponent of an object created by an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code> might call a function that evaluates a completely different <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code>.

<p>For the tasks of a given declarative region, the activations are initiated within the context of the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-11/AA-11.2#S0304">handled{"_"}sequence{"_"}of{"_"}statements</a></code> (and its associated <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-11/AA-11.2#S0305">exception{"_"}handler</a></code>s if any &mdash; see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-11/AA-11.2">11.2</a>), just prior to executing the statements of the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-11/AA-11.2#S0304">handled_sequence_of_statements</a></code>. [For a package without an explicit body or an explicit <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-11/AA-11.2#S0304">handled{"_"}sequence{"_"}of{"_"}statements</a></code>, an implicit body or an implicit <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-5/AA-5.1#S0170">null{"_"}statement</a></code> is assumed, as defined in <a href="/docs/arm/AA-7/AA-7.2">7.2</a>.] <br /></p>

<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00416-01"]} />
<p>For tasks that are part or coextensions of a single object that is not a stand-alone object, activations are initiated after completing any initialization of the outermost object enclosing these tasks, prior to performing any other operation on the outermost object. In particular, for tasks that are part or coextensions of the object created by the evaluation of an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code>, the activations are initiated as the last step of evaluating the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code>, prior to returning the new access value. For tasks that are part or coextensions of an object that is the result of a function call, the activations are not initiated until after the function returns.<br /></p>

<b></b>The intent is that &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; objects with task parts (or coextensions) are treated similarly to an object created by an allocator. The &ldquo;whole&rdquo; object is initialized, and then all of the task parts (including the coextensions) are activated together. Each such &ldquo;whole&rdquo; object has its own task activation sequence, involving the activating task being suspended until all the new tasks complete their activation. <br />

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<p>The task that created the new tasks and initiated their activations (the <i>activator</i>) is blocked until all of these activations complete (successfully or not). Once all of these activations are complete, if the activation of any of the tasks has failed [(due to the propagation of an exception)], Tasking{"_"}Error is raised in the activator, at the place at which it initiated the activations. Otherwise, the activator proceeds with its execution normally. Any tasks that are aborted prior to completing their activation are ignored when determining whether to raise Tasking{"_"}Error. <br /></p>

#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>11.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
We have replaced the term <i>suspended</i> with <i>blocked</i>, since we didn't want to consider a task blocked when it was simply competing for execution resources. "Suspended" is sometimes used more generally to refer to tasks that are not actually running on some processor, due to the lack of resources.<br />

<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00416-01"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Adjusted the wording for activating tasks to handle the case of anonymous function return objects. This is critical; we don't want to be waiting for the tasks in a return object when we exit the function normally. <br />
