#### Documentation Requirements

<MarginText>1/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0439-1"]} />
<p>The implementation shall document the range of effects for each situation that the language rules identify as either a bounded error or as having an unspecified effect. If the implementation can constrain the effects of erroneous execution for a given construct, then it shall document such constraints. [The documentation may be provided either independently of any compilation unit or partition, or as part of an annotated listing for a given unit or partition. See also <a href="/docs/arm/AA-1/AA-1.1#Subclause_1.1.3">1.1.3</a>, and <a href="/docs/arm/AA-1/AA-1.1#Subclause_1.1.2">1.1.2</a>.] <br /></p>

<MarginText>2.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The management of run-time storage is particularly important. For safety applications, it is often necessary to show that a program cannot raise Storage{"_"}Error, and for security applications that information cannot leak via the run-time system. Users are likely to prefer a simple storage model that can be easily validated.<br />

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>2.c</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The documentation could helpfully take into account that users may well adopt a subset to avoid some forms of erroneous execution, for instance, not using the abort statement, so that the effects of a partly completed <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-5/AA-5.2#S0173">assignment_statement</a></code> do not have to be considered in the validation of a program (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.8">9.8</a>). For this reason documentation linked to an actual compilation may be most useful. Similarly, an implementation may be able to take into account use of the Restrictions pragma. <br />
