<p>[The declaration (in the visible part of a package) of a type as a private type or private extension serves to separate the characteristics that can be used directly by outside program units (that is, the logical properties) from other characteristics whose direct use is confined to the package (the details of the definition of the type itself). See <a href="/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.9#Subclause_3.9.1">3.9.1</a> for an overview of type extensions. ]<br /></p>


#### Language Design Principles

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
A private (untagged) type can be thought of as a record type with the type of its single (hidden) component being the full view.<br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
A private tagged type can be thought of as a private extension of an anonymous parent with no components. The only dispatching operation of the parent is equality (although the Size attribute, and, if nonlimited, assignment are allowed, and those will presumably be implemented in terms of dispatching). <br />

We considered a model in which the derived type was implicitly redeclared at the earliest place within its immediate scope where characteristics needed to be added. However, we rejected that model, because (1) it would imply that (for an untagged type) subprograms explicitly declared after the derived type could be inherited, and (2) to make this model work for composite types as well, several implicit redeclarations would be needed, since new characteristics can become visible one by one; that seemed like too much mechanism. <br />

This example is illegal because the completion of T1 is descended from an interface that the partial view is not descended from.

If Foo {"#"}2 overrides Foo {"#"}1, we have a problem because the client redefines a behavior that it doesn't know about, and we try to avoid this at all costs, as it would lead to a breakdown of whatever abstraction was implemented. If the abstraction didn't expose that it implements Ifc, there must be a reason, and it should be able to depend on the fact that no overriding takes place in clients. Also, during maintenance, things may change and the full view might implement a different set of interfaces. Furthermore, the situation is even worse if the full type implements another interface Ifc2 that happens to have a conforming Foo (otherwise unrelated, except for its name and profile).<br />

If Foo {"#"}2 doesn't override Foo {"#"}1, there is some similarity with the case of normal tagged private types, where a client can declare an operation that happens to conform to some private operation, and that's OK, it gets a different slot in the type descriptor. The problem here is that T2 would implement Ifc in two different ways, and through conversions to Ifc'Class we could end up with visibility on both of these two different implementations. This is the &ldquo;diamond inheritance&rdquo; problem of C++ all over again, and we would need some kind of a preference rule to pick one implementation.

This change is made for uniformity with generics, and because the rule as stated is simpler and easier to remember than the Ada 83 rule. In the original version of Ada 83, the same restriction applied to generic formal private types. However, the restriction was removed by the ARG for generics. In order to maintain the &ldquo;generic contract/private type contract analogy&rdquo; discussed above, we have to apply the same rule to package-private types.

<li>Invariant checks on subprogram return are not performed on objects that are accessible only through access-valued components of other objects. This can only cause a leak if there is a type with access-valued components that is used as a parameter or result type of a boundary entity.

<MarginText>23.e/5_7.3.2</MarginText>
<li>A client could call through an access-to-subprogram value and reach a subprogram body that has visibility on the full declaration of a type; no invariant checks will be performed if the designated subprogram is not itself a boundary subprogram.

<li>Invariant checks are only performed for parts of the nominal type for tagged parameters and function results. This means that components of extensions are not checked (these would be very expensive to check as any tagged type <i>might</i> have such an extension in the future, even though that would be very unlikely). For this leak to occur for a type <i>T</i> that has a type invariant, the body of a boundary entity of <i>T</i> needs to have visibility on a type extension that has components of <i>T</i> or access-to-<i>T</i> and also has an ancestor type (or class) as a parameter or result of the subprogram.<br /></li>

<li>Invariant checks are not performed for parts of incomplete types when the completion is not available.

<li>Consider a package <i>P</i> which declares an invariant-bearing private type <i>T</i> and a generic package <i>P.G1</i>, which in turn declares another generic package <i>P.G1.G2</i>. Outside of package <i>P</i>, there are declarations of an instantiation <i>I1</i> of <i>P.G1</i> and an instantiation <i>I2</i> of <i>I1.G2</i>. <i>I2</i> can declare visible subprograms whose bodies see the full view of <i>T</i> and yet these subprograms are not boundary subprograms (because the generic <i>I1.G2</i> is not declared within the immediate scope of <i>T</i> - <i>G1.G2</i> is, but that's irrelevant). So a call to one of these subprograms from outside of <i>P</i> could yield an invariant-violating value.
