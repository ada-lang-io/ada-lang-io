# 7.3 Private Types and Private Extensions

<p>[The declaration (in the visible part of a package) of a type as a private type or private extension serves to separate the characteristics that can be used directly by outside program units (that is, the logical properties) from other characteristics whose direct use is confined to the package (the details of the definition of the type itself). See 3.9.1 for an overview of type extensions. ]</p>

#### Language Design Principles

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>A private (untagged) type can be thought of as a record type with the type of its single (hidden) component being the full view.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>A private tagged type can be thought of as a private extension of an anonymous parent with no components. The only dispatching operation of the parent is equality (although the Size attribute, and, if nonlimited, assignment are allowed, and those will presumably be implemented in terms of dispatching). </p></Admonition>

#### Legality Rules

<p>A <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0232">private_type_declaration</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0233">private_extension_declaration</a></code> declares a <em>partial view</em> of the type; such a declaration is allowed only as a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0087">declarative_item</a></code> of the visible part of a package, and it requires a completion, which shall be a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> that occurs as a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0087">declarative_item</a></code> of the private part of the package. [ The view of the type declared by the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> is called the <em>full view</em>.] A generic formal private type or a generic formal private extension is also a partial view. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>A private type can also be imported (using aspect Import, see B.1), in which case no completion is allowed, if supported by an implementation. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>We originally used the term "private view", but this was easily confused with the view provided <em>from</em> the private part, namely the full view. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>Proof: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} Full view is now defined in 3.2.1, "Type Declarations", as all types now have them. </p></Admonition>

<p>[A type shall be completely defined before it is frozen (see 3.11.1 and 13.14). Thus, neither the declaration of a variable of a partial view of a type, nor the creation by an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code> of an object of the partial view are allowed before the full declaration of the type. Similarly, before the full declaration, the name of the partial view cannot be used in a <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0315">generic_instantiation</a></code> or in a representation item.] </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>Proof: </strong>This rule is stated officially in 3.11.1, "Completions of Declarations". </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00419-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00443-01"}</em>{"}"} [A private type is limited if its declaration includes the reserved word <strong>limited</strong>; a private extension is limited if its ancestor type is a limited type that is not an interface type, or if the reserved word <strong>limited</strong> or <strong>synchronized</strong> appears in its definition.] If the partial view is nonlimited, then the full view shall be nonlimited. If a tagged partial view is limited, then the full view shall be limited. [On the other hand, if an untagged partial view is limited, the full view may be limited or nonlimited.]</p>
<p>If the partial view is tagged, then the full view shall be tagged. [On the other hand, if the partial view is untagged, then the full view may be tagged or untagged.] In the case where the partial view is untagged and the full view is tagged, no derivatives of the partial view are allowed within the immediate scope of the partial view; [derivatives of the full view are allowed.] </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>Note that deriving from a partial view within its immediate scope can only occur in a package that is a child of the one where the partial view is declared. The rule implies that in the visible part of a public child package, it is impossible to derive from an untagged private type declared in the visible part of the parent package in the case where the full view of the parent type turns out to be tagged. We considered a model in which the derived type was implicitly redeclared at the earliest place within its immediate scope where characteristics needed to be added. However, we rejected that model, because (1) it would imply that (for an untagged type) subprograms explicitly declared after the derived type could be inherited, and (2) to make this model work for composite types as well, several implicit redeclarations would be needed, since new characteristics can become visible one by one; that seemed like too much mechanism. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>The rule for tagged partial views is redundant for partial views that are private extensions, since all extensions of a given ancestor tagged type are tagged, and limited if the ancestor is limited. We phrase this rule partially redundantly to keep its structure parallel with the other rules. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>This rule is checked in a generic unit, rather than using the "assume the best" or "assume the worst" method. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00230-01"}</em>{"}"} Tagged limited private types have certain capabilities that are incompatible with having assignment for the full view of the type. In particular, tagged limited private types can be extended with components of a limited type, which works only because assignment is not allowed. Consider the following example: </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
package P1 is{"\n"}    type T1 is tagged limited private;{"\n"}    procedure Foo(X : in T1'Class);{"\n"}private{"\n"}    type T1 is tagged null record; -- Illegal!{"\n"}        -- This should say "tagged limited null record".{"\n"}end P1;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
package body P1 is{"\n"}    type A is access T1'Class;{"\n"}    Global : A;{"\n"}    procedure Foo(X : in T1'Class) is{"\n"}    begin{"\n"}        Global := new T1'Class'(X);{"\n"}            -- This would be illegal if the full view of{"\n"}            -- T1 were limited, like it's supposed to be.{"\n"}    end Foo;{"\n"}end P1;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
{"{"}{"AI95-00230-01"}{"}"} with P1;{"\n"}package P2 is{"\n"}    type T2(D : access Integer){"\n"}            is new P1.T1 with{"\n"}        record{"\n"}            My_Task : Some_Task_Type; -- Trouble!{"\n"}        end record;{"\n"}end P2;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
with P1;{"\n"}with P2;{"\n"}procedure Main is{"\n"}    Local : aliased Integer;{"\n"}    Y : P2.T2(D ={">"} Local'Access);{"\n"}begin{"\n"}    P1.Foo(Y);{"\n"}end Main;{"\n"}  {"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00230-01"}</em>{"}"} If the above example were legal, we would have succeeded in doing an assignment of a task object, which is supposed to be a no-no. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>This rule is not needed for private extensions, because they inherit their limitedness from their ancestor, and there is a separate rule forbidding limited components of the corresponding record extension if the parent is nonlimited. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>A type derived from an untagged private type is untagged, even if the full view of the parent is tagged, and even at places that can see the parent: </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
package P is{"\n"}    type Parent is private;{"\n"}private{"\n"}    type Parent is tagged{"\n"}        record{"\n"}            X: Integer;{"\n"}        end record;{"\n"}end P;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
with P;{"\n"}package Q is{"\n"}    type T is new P.Parent;{"\n"}end Q;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
with Q; use Q;{"\n"}package body P is{"\n"}    ... T'Class ... -- Illegal!{"\n"}    Object: T;{"\n"}    ... Object.X ... -- Illegal!{"\n"}    ... Parent(Object).X ... -- OK.{"\n"}end P;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The declaration of T declares an untagged view. This view is always untagged, so T'Class is illegal, it would be illegal to extend T, and so forth. The component name X is never visible for this view, although the component is still there - one can get one's hands on it via a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code>.</p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00396-01"}</em>{"}"} If a full type has a partial view that is tagged, then: </p>
<p>the partial view shall be a synchronized tagged type (see 3.9.4) if and only if the full type is a synchronized tagged type;</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>Since we do not allow record extensions of synchronized tagged types, this property has to be visible in the partial view to avoid privacy breaking. Generic formals do not need a similar rule as any extensions are rechecked for legality in the specification, and extensions of tagged formals are always illegal in a generic body. </p></Admonition>

<p>the partial view shall be a descendant of an interface type (see 3.9.4) if and only if the full type is a descendant of the interface type.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>Consider the following example: </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
package P is{"\n"}   package Pkg is{"\n"}      type Ifc is interface;{"\n"}      procedure Foo (X : Ifc) is abstract;{"\n"}   end Pkg;{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
   type T1 is new Parent_2 with null record; -- Illegal.{"\n"}end P;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>

</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
{"{"}{"AI12-0005-1"}{"}"}    procedure Bar (X : T1'Class) is{"\n"}   begin{"\n"}      Pkg.Foo (Pkg.Ifc'Class (X)); -- should call Foo #1 or an override thereof{"\n"}   end;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>

</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>This example is illegal because the completion of T1 is descended from an interface that the partial view is not descended from. If it were legal, T2 would implement Ifc twice, once in the visible part of P, and once in the visible part of P_Client. We would need to decide how Foo #1 and Foo #2 relate to each other. There are two options: either Foo #2 overrides Foo #1, or it doesn't.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>If Foo #2 overrides Foo #1, we have a problem because the client redefines a behavior that it doesn't know about, and we try to avoid this at all costs, as it would lead to a breakdown of whatever abstraction was implemented. If the abstraction didn't expose that it implements Ifc, there must be a reason, and it should be able to depend on the fact that no overriding takes place in clients. Also, during maintenance, things may change and the full view might implement a different set of interfaces. Furthermore, the situation is even worse if the full type implements another interface Ifc2 that happens to have a conforming Foo (otherwise unrelated, except for its name and profile).</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>If Foo #2 doesn't override Foo #1, there is some similarity with the case of normal tagged private types, where a client can declare an operation that happens to conform to some private operation, and that's OK, it gets a different slot in the type descriptor. The problem here is that T2 would implement Ifc in two different ways, and through conversions to Ifc'Class we could end up with visibility on both of these two different implementations. This is the "diamond inheritance" problem of C++ all over again, and we would need some kind of a preference rule to pick one implementation. We don't want to go there (if we did, we might as well provide full-fledged multiple inheritance).</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Note that there wouldn't be any difficulty to implement the first option, so the restriction is essentially methodological. The second option might be harder to implement, depending on the language rules that we would choose. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} This rule also prevents completing a private type with an interface. An interface, like all types, is a descendant of itself, and thus this rule is triggered. One reason this is necessary is that a client of a private extension should be able to inherit limitedness without having to look in the private part to see if the type is an interface (remember that limitedness of interfaces is never inherited, while it is inherited from other types). </p></Admonition>

<p>The <em>ancestor subtype</em> of a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0233">private_extension_declaration</a></code> is the subtype defined by the <em>ancestor_</em><code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0027">subtype_indication</a></code>; the ancestor type shall be a specific tagged type. The full view of a private extension shall be derived (directly or indirectly) from the ancestor type. In addition to the places where Legality Rules normally apply (see 12.3), the requirement that the ancestor be specific applies also in the private part of an instance of a generic unit. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>This rule allows the full view to be defined through several intermediate derivations, possibly from a series of types produced by <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0315">generic_instantiation</a></code>s. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00419-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00443-01"}</em>{"}"} If the reserved word <strong>limited</strong> appears in a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0233">private_extension_declaration</a></code>, the ancestor type shall be a limited type. If the reserved word <strong>synchronized</strong> appears in a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0233">private_extension_declaration</a></code>, the ancestor type shall be a limited interface.</p>
<p>If the declaration of a partial view includes a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0061">known_discriminant_part</a></code>, then the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> shall have a fully conforming [(explicit)] <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0061">known_discriminant_part</a></code> [(see 6.3.1, "Conformance Rules")]. [The ancestor subtype may be unconstrained; the parent subtype of the full view is required to be constrained (see 3.7).] </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>If the ancestor subtype has discriminants, then it is usually best to make it unconstrained. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>If the partial view has a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0061">known_discriminant_part</a></code>, then the full view has to be a composite, non-array type, since only such types may have known discriminants. Also, the full view cannot inherit the discriminants in this case; the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0061">known_discriminant_part</a></code> has to be explicit.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>That is, the following is illegal: </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
package P is{"\n"}    type T(D : Integer) is private;{"\n"}private{"\n"}    type T is new Some_Other_Type; -- Illegal!{"\n"}end P;{"\n"}  {"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>even if Some_Other_Type has an integer discriminant called D.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>It is a ramification of this and other rules that in order for a tagged type to privately inherit unconstrained discriminants, the private type declaration has to have an <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0060">unknown_discriminant_part</a></code>. </p></Admonition>

<p>If a private extension inherits known discriminants from the ancestor subtype, then the full view shall also inherit its discriminants from the ancestor subtype, and the parent subtype of the full view shall be constrained if and only if the ancestor subtype is constrained. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>The first part ensures that the full view has the same discriminants as the partial view. The second part ensures that if the partial view is unconstrained, then the full view is also unconstrained; otherwise, a client might constrain the partial view in a way that conflicts with the constraint on the full view. </p></Admonition>

<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0004-1"}</em>{"}"} The word <strong>limited</strong> is optional (unless the ancestor is an interface), but it should be used consistently. Otherwise things would be too confusing for the reader. Of course, we only require that if the full type includes a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.4#S0035">derived_type_definition</a></code>, as we want to allow task and protected types to complete extensions of synchronized interfaces. </p></Admonition>

<p>[If a partial view has unknown discriminants, then the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> may define a definite or an indefinite subtype, with or without discriminants.]</p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">

#### Static Semantics

<p>A <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0232">private_type_declaration</a></code> declares a private type and its first subtype. Similarly, a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0233">private_extension_declaration</a></code> declares a private extension and its first subtype. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>A <em>package-private type</em> is one declared by a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0232">private_type_declaration</a></code>; that is, a private type other than a generic formal private type. Similarly, a <em>package-private extension</em> is one declared by a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0233">private_extension_declaration</a></code>. These terms are not used in the RM95 version of this document. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0269-1"}</em>{"}"} A declaration of a partial view and the corresponding <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> define two views of a single type. The declaration of a partial view together with the visible part define the operations that are available to outside program units; the declaration of the full view together with the private part define other operations whose direct use is possible only within the declarative region of the package itself. Moreover, within the scope of the declaration of the full view, the characteristics (see 3.4) of the type are determined by the full view; in particular, within its scope, the full view determines the classes that include the type, which components, entries, and protected subprograms are visible, what attributes and other predefined operations are allowed, and whether the first subtype is static. See 7.3.1.</p>

#### Dynamic Semantics

<p>The elaboration of a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0232">private_type_declaration</a></code> creates a partial view of a type. The elaboration of a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0233">private_extension_declaration</a></code> elaborates the <em>ancestor_</em><code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0027">subtype_indication</a></code>, and creates a partial view of a type. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 1   {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0442-1"}</em>{"}"} The partial view of a type as declared by a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0232">private_type_declaration</a></code> is defined to be a composite view (in 3.2). The full view of the type can be elementary or composite. A private extension is also composite, as is its full view.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 2   {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00318-02"}</em>{"}"} Declaring a private type with an <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0060">unknown_discriminant_part</a></code> is a way of preventing clients from creating uninitialized objects of the type; they are then forced to initialize each object by calling some operation declared in the visible part of the package. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>Packages with private types are analogous to generic packages with formal private types, as follows: The declaration of a package-private type is like the declaration of a formal private type. The visible part of the package is like the generic formal part; these both specify a contract (that is, a set of operations and other things available for the private type). The private part of the package is like an instantiation of the generic; they both give a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> that specifies implementation details of the private type. The clients of the package are like the body of the generic; usage of the private type in these places is restricted to the operations defined by the contract.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>In other words, being inside the package is like being outside the generic, and being outside the package is like being inside the generic; a generic is like an "inside-out" package.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>This analogy also works for private extensions in the same inside-out way.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Many of the legality rules are defined with this analogy in mind. See, for example, the rules relating to operations of [formal] derived types.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The completion rules for a private type are intentionally quite similar to the matching rules for a generic formal private type.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>This analogy breaks down in one respect: a generic actual subtype is a subtype, whereas the full view for a private type is always a new type. (We considered allowing the completion of a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0232">private_type_declaration</a></code> to be a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0026">subtype_declaration</a></code>, but the semantics just won't work.) This difference is behind the fact that a generic actual type can be class-wide, whereas the completion of a private type always declares a specific type. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The syntax for a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0232">private_type_declaration</a></code> is augmented to allow the reserved word <strong>tagged</strong>.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>In Ada 83, a private type without discriminants cannot be completed with a type with discriminants. Ada 95 allows the full view to have discriminants, so long as they have defaults (that is, so long as the first subtype is definite). This change is made for uniformity with generics, and because the rule as stated is simpler and easier to remember than the Ada 83 rule. In the original version of Ada 83, the same restriction applied to generic formal private types. However, the restriction was removed by the ARG for generics. In order to maintain the "generic contract/private type contract analogy" discussed above, we have to apply the same rule to package-private types. Note that a private untagged type without discriminants can be completed with a tagged type with discriminants only if the full view is constrained, because discriminants of tagged types cannot have defaults. </p></Admonition>

<p>RM83-7.4.1(4), "Within the specification of the package that declares a private type and before the end of the corresponding full type declaration, a restriction applies....", is subsumed (and corrected) by the rule that a type shall be completely defined before it is frozen, and the rule that the parent type of a derived type declaration shall be completely defined, unless the derived type is a private extension. </p></Admonition>

## 7.3.1  Private Operations

<p>[For a type declared in the visible part of a package or generic package, certain operations on the type do not become visible until later in the package - either in the private part or the body. Such <em>private operations</em> are available only inside the declarative region of the package or generic package.] </p>

#### Static Semantics

<p>The predefined operators that exist for a given type are determined by the classes to which the type belongs. For example, an integer type has a predefined "+" operator. In most cases, the predefined operators of a type are declared immediately after the definition of the type; the exceptions are explained below. Inherited subprograms are also implicitly declared immediately after the definition of the type, except as stated below.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0019</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00033-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0029-1"}</em>{"}"} For a composite type, the characteristics (see 7.3) of the type are determined in part by the characteristics of its component types. At the place where the composite type is declared, the only characteristics of component types used are those characteristics visible at that place. If later immediately within the declarative region in which the composite type is declared additional characteristics become visible for a component type, then any corresponding characteristics become visible for the composite type. Any additional predefined operators are implicitly declared at that place. If there is no such place, then additional predefined operators are not declared at all, but they still exist.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0029-1"}</em>{"}"} We say that the predefined operators exist because they can emerge in some unusual generic instantiations. See 12.5. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0029-1"}</em>{"}"} The predefined operators for the underlying class of a type always exist, even if there is no visibility on that underlying class. This rule is simply about where (if ever) those operators are declared (and thus become usable). The "additional predefined operators" defined by this rule are any that are not declared at the point of the original type declaration. For instance, a type derived from a private type whose full type is type String always will have a "{">"}" operator, but where that operator is declared (and thus whether it is visible) will depend on the visibility of the full type of the parent type. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0019</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00033-01"}</em>{"}"} The corresponding rule applies to a type defined by a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.4#S0035">derived_type_definition</a></code>, if there is a place immediately within the declarative region in which the type is declared where additional characteristics of its parent type become visible.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0019</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00033-01"}</em>{"}"} [For example, an array type whose component type is limited private becomes nonlimited if the full view of the component type is nonlimited and visible at some later place immediately within the declarative region in which the array type is declared. In such a case, the predefined "=" operator is implicitly declared at that place, and assignment is allowed after that place.]</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0140-1"}</em>{"}"} The characteristics and constraints of the designated subtype of an access type follow a somewhat different rule. The view of the designated subtype of (a view of) an access type at a given place is determined by the view of the designated subtype that is visible at that place, rather than the view at the place where the access type is declared.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">

More generally, at any given place, a type is descended from the same view of an ancestor as that from which the current view of its parent is descended. This view determines what characteristics are inherited from the ancestor[, and, for example, whether the type is considered to be a descendant of a record type, or a descendant only through record extensions of a more distant ancestor].</p>

#### Examples

<p><em>Example of a type with private operations:</em> </p>
<CodeBlock>
package Key_Manager is{"\n"}   type Key is private;{"\n"}   Null_Key : constant Key; -- a deferred constant declaration (see 7.4){"\n"}   procedure Get_Key(K : out Key);{"\n"}   function "{"<"}" (X, Y : Key) return Boolean;{"\n"}private{"\n"}   type Key is new Natural;{"\n"}   Null_Key : constant Key := Key'First;{"\n"}end Key_Manager;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
package body Key_Manager is{"\n"}   Last_Key : Key := Null_Key;{"\n"}   procedure Get_Key(K : out Key) is{"\n"}   begin{"\n"}      Last_Key := Last_Key + 1;{"\n"}      K := Last_Key;{"\n"}   end Get_Key;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
   function "{"<"}" (X, Y : Key) return Boolean is{"\n"}   begin{"\n"}      return Natural(X) {"<"} Natural(Y);{"\n"}   end "{"<"}";{"\n"}end Key_Manager;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 4   <em>Notes on the example:</em> Outside of the package Key_Manager, the operations available for objects of type Key include assignment, the comparison for equality or inequality, the procedure Get_Key and the operator "{"<"}"; they do not include other relational operators such as "{">"}=", or arithmetic operators.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The explicitly declared operator "{"<"}" hides the predefined operator "{"<"}" implicitly declared by the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code>. Within the body of the function, an explicit conversion of X and Y to the subtype Natural is necessary to invoke the "{"<"}" operator of the parent type. Alternatively, the result of the function can be written as <strong>not</strong> (X {">"}= Y), since the operator "{">"}=" is not redefined.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The value of the variable Last_Key, declared in the package body, remains unchanged between calls of the procedure Get_Key. (See also the NOTES of 7.2.) </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The phrase in RM83-7.4.2(7), "...after the full type declaration", doesn't work in the presence of child units, so we define that rule in terms of visibility.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The definition of the Constrained attribute for private types has been moved to "Obsolescent Features". (The Constrained attribute of an object has not been moved there.) </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0115-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong></strong> Clarified that the characteristics of a descendant of a private type depend on the visibility of the full view of the direct ancestor.

#### Wording Changes from Ada 2012

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0065-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Clarified the clarification added by AI05-0115-1, as it turned out to not be that clear. Hopefully this version is better.</p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0075-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0191-1"}</em>{"}"} For a nonabstract type <em>T</em>, a callable entity is said to be a <em>boundary entity</em> for <em>T</em> if it is declared within the immediate scope of <em>T</em> (or by an instance of a generic unit, and the generic is declared within the immediate scope of type <em>T</em>), or is the Read or Input stream-oriented attribute of type <em>T</em>, and either:</p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0191-1"}</em>{"}"} A boundary entity for type <em>T</em> is one that might require an invariant check for <em>T</em>.

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0133-1"}</em>{"}"} The check applies everywhere, even in the package body, because default initialization has to work the same for clients as it does within the package. As such, checks within the package are either harmless or will uncover a bug that could also happen to a client. However, if the partial view of the type has unknown discriminants, no client of the package can declare a default-initialized object. Therefore, no invariant check is needed, as all default initialized objects are necessarily inside the package. </p></Admonition>

<p>after assigning to the view conversion; and</p>
<p>after successful return from a call that passes the view conversion as an <strong>in out</strong> or <strong>out</strong> parameter. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>For a single view conversion that converts between distantly related types, this rule could be triggered for multiple types and thus multiple invariant checks may be needed. </p></Admonition>

<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} For calls to inherited subprograms (including dispatching calls), the implied view conversions mean that a wrapper is probably needed.

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>For view conversions involving class-wide types, the exact checks needed may not be known at compile-time. One way to deal with this is to have an implicit dispatching operation that is given the object to check and the tag of the target of the conversion, and which first checks if the passed tag is not for itself, and if not, checks the its invariant on the object and then calls the operation of its parent type. If the tag is for itself, the operation is complete. </p></Admonition>

We do, however, use the nominal type of objects to determine if a part of type <em>T</em> is present; therefore, parts that aren't known at compile-time (after ignoring privacy) are never subject to an invariant check. This is preferable, as we don't want overhead associated with the possibility that there <em>might</em> exist an extension of a tagged type that has a part of type <em>T</em>.

This goal is not completely achieved; such leaking is possible but, importantly, it requires assistance (deliberate or not) of some form from the package that declares the invariant-bearing private type (or a child unit thereof); a client of a well-crafted package cannot use these holes to obtain an invariant-violating value without help.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0210-1"}</em>{"}"} The list of known techniques whereby this kind of leak can occur (ignoring things like erroneous execution and the various forms of unchecked type conversion) consists of:</p></Admonition>

<p>A boundary entity might assign an invariant-violating value to a global variable that is visible to client code.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0149-1"}</em>{"}"} Invariant checks on subprogram return are not performed on objects that are accessible only through access-valued components of other objects. This can only cause a leak if there is a type with access-valued components that is used as a parameter or result type of a boundary entity. For a type <em>T</em> that has a type invariant, avoiding the declaration of types with access-valued components designating objects with parts of <em>T</em> in the package that contains <em>T</em> is sufficient to prevent this leak.</p>
<p>A client could call through an access-to-subprogram value and reach a subprogram body that has visibility on the full declaration of a type; no invariant checks will be performed if the designated subprogram is not itself a boundary subprogram. This leak can only happen if an access-to-subprogram value of a subprogram that is not visible to clients is passed out to clients.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0167-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0191-1"}</em>{"}"} Invariant checks are only performed for parts of the nominal type for tagged parameters and function results. This means that components of extensions are not checked (these would be very expensive to check as any tagged type <em>might</em> have such an extension in the future, even though that would be very unlikely). For this leak to occur for a type <em>T</em> that has a type invariant, the body of a boundary entity of <em>T</em> needs to have visibility on a type extension that has components of <em>T</em> or access-to-<em>T</em> and also has an ancestor type (or class) as a parameter or result of the subprogram.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0338-1"}</em>{"}"} Invariant checks are not performed for parts of incomplete types when the completion is not available. For this leak to occur for a type <em>T</em> that has a type invariant and is declared in a package <em>P</em>, one has to use a <strong>limited with</strong> on a package that has <em>P</em> in its semantic closure, and then use a type from that package as a parameter or result of a boundary subprogram for <em>T</em> (or as the designated type of a parameter or result of such a subprogram).</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0210-1"}</em>{"}"} Consider a package <em>P</em> which declares an invariant-bearing private type <em>T</em> and a generic package <em>P.G1</em>, which in turn declares another generic package <em>P.G1.G2</em>. Outside of package <em>P</em>, there are declarations of an instantiation <em>I1</em> of <em>P.G1</em> and an instantiation <em>I2</em> of <em>I1.G2</em>. <em>I2</em> can declare visible subprograms whose bodies see the full view of <em>T</em> and yet these subprograms are not boundary subprograms (because the generic <em>I1.G2</em> is not declared within the immediate scope of <em>T</em> - <em>G1.G2</em> is, but that's irrelevant). So a call to one of these subprograms from outside of <em>P</em> could yield an invariant-violating value. So long as a nested generic of a nested generic unit of <em>P</em> is not declared, no such leaks are possible.</p>

<p>NOTE   {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0250-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0269-1"}</em>{"}"} For a call of a primitive subprogram of type <em>NT</em> that is inherited from type <em>T</em>, the specified checks of the specific invariants of both the types <em>NT</em> and <em>T</em> are performed.

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>Proof: </strong>This follows from the definition of a call on an inherited subprogram as view conversions of the parameters of the type and a call to the original subprogram (see 3.4), along with the normal invariant checking rules. In particular, the call to the original subprogram takes care of any checks needed on type <em>T</em>, and the checks required on view conversions take care of any checks needed on type <em>NT</em>, specifically on <strong>in out</strong> and <strong>out</strong> parameters. We require this in order that the semantics of an explicitly defined wrapper that does nothing but call the original subprogram is the same as that of an inherited subprogram. </p></Admonition>

#### Inconsistencies With Ada 2012

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0042-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Clarified the definition of when invariant checks occur for inherited subprograms. This might cause checks to be added or removed in some cases. These are all rare cases involving class-wide type invariants and either record extensions or multiple levels of derivation. Additionally, implementations probably make the checks as the intent seems clear, even though the formal language did not include them. So we do not expect this to be a problem in practice.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0042-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Added invariant checks for conversions to class-wide types. This might cause an invariant check to fail in some cases where they would not be made in the original definition of Ada 2012. Such cases represent a hole where a value that fails an invariant could "leak out" of a package, and as such will detect far more bugs than it causes.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0044-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Removed the invariant check for <strong>in</strong> parameters of functions, so that typical invariants don't cause infinite recursion. This is strictly inconsistent, as the Ada 2012 definition has this check; therefore, programs could depend on Assertion_Error being raised upon the return from some call on a public function. However, as the intent of assertion checking is to uncover bugs, a program that depends on a bug occurring seems very unlikely.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0049-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0149-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Added an invariant check for deferred constants and for access values returned from functions, so they cannot be used to "leak" values that violate the invariant from a package. This is strictly inconsistent, as the Ada 2012 definition is missing these checks; therefore, programs could depend on using values that violate an invariant outside of the package of definition. These will not raise Assertion_Error in Ada 2012 as defined in the Ada 2012 Reference Manual, but ought to do so (as noted by this change). As these are a violation of the intent of invariants, we think that this change will mainly reveal bugs rather than cause them.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0150-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0159-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Eliminated unintentional redispatching from class-wide type invariants. This means that a different body might be evaluated for a type invariant check where the value has a different tag than that of the type. The change means that the behavior of Type_Invariant and Type_Invariant'Class will be the same for a particular subprogram, and that the known behavior of the operations can be assumed. We expect that this change will primarily fix bugs, as it will make class-wide type invariants work more like expected. In the case where redispatching is desired, an explicit conversion to a class-wide type can be used.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0199-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong></strong> Class-wide type invariants are no longer checked for abstract types. Thus, a program that previously raised Assertion_Error because of a call to a concrete subprogram of an abstract type will no longer do so. However, programs that depend on assertion failure are likely to be very rare, some explicit conversion to the abstract type is needed to get static binding, and additionally many such checks would call abstract functions (likely causing some compiler failure). As such, this incompatibility most likely will never be seen in practice. </p></Admonition>

This is a very unlikely situation, and will prevent problems with invariant checks being added to routines that assume that they don't have them. Note: The original wording was missing the restriction to the visible part of the package, this was added later for Ada 2022. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0133-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Clarified that all objects that are initialized by default should have an invariant check, and added an exception for types with unknown discriminants, as in that case the client cannot declare a default-initialized object. This exception to the check is formally inconsistent, but since it is only removing an assertion failure that occurs where no assertion should be checked anyway (meaning it's more likely to fix a bug than cause one), and programs depending on assertion failure should be very rare outside of test cases, we don't document this as inconsistent.</p></Admonition>

#### Name Resolution Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0265-1"}</em>{"}"} The expected type for a default initial condition expression is any boolean type.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0397-1"}</em>{"}"} Within a default initial condition expression associated with a declaration for a type T, a name that denotes the declaration is interpreted as a current instance of a notional (nonabstract) formal derived type NT with ancestor T, that has directly visible primitive operations.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>This is analogous to the rule for Post'Class (see 6.1.1) and ensures that the expression is well-defined for any descendant of type T. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>The operations of NT are also nonabstract, so the rule against a call of an abstract subprogram does not trigger for a default initial condition for an abstract type. Note that, presuming T is tagged, it is possible to call class-wide operations of the type T given an object of type NT. Similarly it is possible to explicitly convert an object of type NT to a subtype of T, and pass it to a nonprimitive operation expecting a parameter of type T. [Note that one cannot directly convert to (the first subtype of) T since it represents the current instance of the type within the aspect expression, but one can convert to a subtype of T (including a subtype that matches the first subtype).] </p></Admonition>


#### Legality Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0265-1"}</em>{"}"} The Default_Initial_Condition aspect shall not be specified for a type whose partial view has unknown discriminants[, whether explicitly declared or inherited].</p>

#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0265-1"}</em>{"}"} If the Default_Initial_Condition aspect is specified for a type T, then the default initial condition expression applies to T and to all descendants of T.</p>

#### Dynamic Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0265-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0397-1"}</em>{"}"} If one or more default initial condition expressions apply to a [(nonabstract)] type T, then a default initial condition check is performed after successful initialization of an object of type T by default (see 3.3.1). In the case of a controlled type, the check is performed after the call to the type's Initialize procedure (see 7.6).</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>Proof: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0397-1"}</em>{"}"} If T is an abstract type, then there will never be an initialization of an object of the type. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0265-1"}</em>{"}"} If performing checks is required by the Default_Initial_Condition assertion policy (see 11.4.2) in effect at the point of the corresponding <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code> applicable to a given type, then the respective default initial condition expression is considered enabled.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0265-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0397-1"}</em>{"}"} The default initial condition check consists of the evaluation of each enabled default initial condition expression that applies to T. Any operations within such an expression that were resolved as primitive operations of the (notional) formal derived type NT, are in the evaluation of the expression resolved as for a formal derived type in an instance with T as the actual type for NT (see 12.5.1). These evaluations, if there are more than one, are performed in an arbitrary order. If any of these evaluate to False, Assertions.Assertion_Error is raised at the point of the object initialization.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0397-1"}</em>{"}"} Just as is true for a formal derived type (see 12.5.1), for a tagged type T, the controlling tag of a call on a primitive of NT will cause the body of the corresponding primitive of T to be executed. For an untagged type T, invoking a primitive of NT will cause the body of the operation of the type where the aspect originated to be executed, with conversions performed as for an inherited subprogram. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0272-1"}</em>{"}"} [For a generic formal type T, default initial condition checks performed are as determined by the actual type, along with any default initial condition of the formal type itself.]</p>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} For a primitive subprogram, the following language-defined aspects may be specified with an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code> (see 13.1.1):</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0285-1"}</em>{"}"} Stable_PropertiesThis aspect shall be specified by a subprogram property aspect definition; each <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> shall statically denote a single property function of a type for which the associated subprogram is primitive.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0285-1"}</em>{"}"} Stable_Properties'ClassThis aspect shall be specified by a subprogram property aspect definition; each <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> shall statically denote a single property function of a tagged type for which the associated subprogram is primitive. [Unlike most class-wide aspects, Stable_Properties'Class is not inherited by descendant subprograms, but the enhanced class-wide postconditions are inherited in the normal manner.]</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>The subprogram versions of Stable_Properties are provided to allow overriding the stable properties of a type for an individual primitive subprogram. While they can be used even if the type has no stable properties, that is not an intended use (as simply modifying the postcondition directly makes more sense for something that only happens in one place). </p></Admonition>


#### Legality Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} A stable property function of a type <em>T</em> shall have a nonlimited return type and shall be:</p>
<p>a primitive function with a single parameter of mode <strong>in</strong> of type <em>T</em>; or</p>
<p>a function that is declared immediately within the declarative region in which an ancestor type of <em>T</em> is declared and has a single parameter of mode <strong>in</strong> of a class-wide type that covers <em>T</em>. </p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0285-1"}</em>{"}"} In a subprogram property aspect definition for a subprogram <em>S</em>:</p>
<p>all or none of the items shall be preceded by <strong>not</strong>;</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>Mixing <strong>not</strong> functions with regular functions is not allowed. </p></Admonition>

<p>any property functions mentioned after <strong>not</strong> shall be a stable property function of a type for which <em>S</em> is primitive. </p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0405-1"}</em>{"}"} If a <code><a href="../AA-8/AA-8.5#S0242">subprogram_renaming_declaration</a></code> declares a primitive subprogram of a type <em>T</em>, then the renamed callable entity shall also be a primitive subprogram of type <em>T</em> and the two primitive subprograms shall have the same specific stable property functions and the same class-wide stable property functions (see below).</p>

#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} For a primitive subprogram <em>S</em> of a type <em>T</em>, the specific stable property functions of <em>S</em> for type <em>T</em> are:</p>
<p>if <em>S</em> has an aspect Stable_Properties specified that does not include <strong>not</strong>, those functions denoted in the aspect Stable_Properties for <em>S</em> that have a parameter of <em>T</em> or <em>T</em>'Class;</p>
<p>if <em>S</em> has an aspect Stable_Properties specified that includes <strong>not</strong>, those functions denoted in the aspect Stable_Properties for <em>T</em>, excluding those denoted in the aspect Stable_Properties for <em>S</em>;</p>
<p>if <em>S</em> does not have an aspect Stable_Properties, those functions denoted in the aspect Stable_Properties for <em>T</em>, if any.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>A primitive subprogram can be primitive for more than one type, and thus there can be more than one such set of specific stable properties for a subprogram. Thus we say "specific stable property functions for subprogram <em>S</em> for type <em>T</em>". </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} A similar definition applies for class-wide stable property functions by replacing aspect Stable_Properties with aspect Stable_Properties'Class in the above definition.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} The <em>explicit</em> specific postcondition expression for a subprogram <em>S</em> is the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> directly specified for <em>S</em> with the Post aspect. Similarly, the <em>explicit</em> class-wide postcondition expression for a subprogram <em>S</em> is the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> directly specified for <em>S</em> with the Post'Class aspect.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} For a primitive subprogram <em>S</em> of a type <em>T</em> that has a parameter <em>P</em> of type <em>T</em>, the parameter is <em>excluded from stable property checks</em> if:</p>
<p><em>S</em> is a stable property function of <em>T</em>;</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>This prevents possible infinite recursion, where the postcondition calls the function itself (directly or indirectly). </p></Admonition>

<p><em>P</em> has mode <strong>out</strong>;</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>A parameter of mode <strong>out</strong> doesn't necessarily have a defined input value, so there is no old value to compare with. Ideally, the postcondition will include expressions defining the values of the stable properties after the call, but we do not try to ensure this. </p></Admonition>

<p>the Global aspect of <em>S</em> is <strong>null</strong>, and <em>P</em> has mode <strong>in</strong> and the mode is not overridden by a global aspect.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>An <strong>in</strong> parameter of a Global ={">"} <strong>null</strong> subprogram cannot be modified, even if it has indirect parts, without violating the Global aspect. Thus, there is no need to assert that the properties don't change. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0324-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0405-1"}</em>{"}"} For every primitive subprogram <em>S</em> of a type <em>T</em> that is not an abstract subprogram or null procedure, the specific postcondition expression of <em>S</em> is modified to include expressions of the form <em>F</em>(<em>P</em>) = <em>F</em>(<em>P</em>)'Old, all <strong>and</strong>ed with each other and any explicit specific postcondition expression, with one such equality included for each specific stable property function <em>F</em> of <em>S</em> for type <em>T</em> that does not occur in the explicit specific postcondition expression of <em>S</em>, and <em>P</em> is each parameter of <em>S</em> that has type <em>T</em> and is not excluded from stable property checks. The resulting specific postcondition expression of <em>S</em> is used in place of the explicit specific postcondition expression of <em>S</em> [when interpreting the meaning of the postcondition as defined in 6.1.1].</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>There is one F(P) = F(P)'Old subexpression for every combination of a specific stable property function of type <em>T</em> and a parameter of type <em>T</em>. For instance, if there are three specific stable property functions for type <em>T</em> and two parameters of type <em>T</em>, then there are six such subexpressions appended to the postcondition.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The resulting specific postcondition is evaluated as described in 6.1.1. One hopes that compilers can be smart enough to prove that many of these added postcondition subexpressions cannot fail, but that is not required here. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>Null procedures and abstract subprograms are excluded as they do not allow specific postconditions. Moreover, for null procedures, static analysis tools can be certain that their parameters aren't modified so there is no need to assert that the properties don't change. Abstract subprograms cannot be directly called. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0187-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0324-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0405-1"}</em>{"}"} For every primitive subprogram <em>S</em> of a type <em>T</em>, the class-wide postcondition expression of <em>S</em> is modified to include expressions of the form <em>F</em>(<em>P</em>) = <em>F</em>(<em>P</em>)'Old, all <strong>and</strong>ed with each other and any explicit class-wide postcondition expression, with one such equality included for each class-wide stable property function <em>F</em> of <em>S</em> for type <em>T</em> that does not occur in any class-wide postcondition expression that applies to <em>S</em>, and <em>P</em> is each parameter of <em>S</em> that has type <em>T</em> and is not excluded from stable property checks. The resulting class-wide postcondition expression of <em>S</em> is used in place of the explicit class-wide postcondition expression of <em>S</em> [when interpreting the meaning of the postcondition as defined in 6.1.1].</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>We suppress stable property expressions if the property function appears in the explicit class-wide postcondition, or in any inherited class-wide postconditions. If we didn't do that, we could have conflicting requirements in an inherited postcondition and the current one. We also avoid redundant property checks. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>The resulting class-wide postcondition is evaluated as described in 6.1.1. In particular, the enhanced class-wide postcondition <em>is</em> the class-wide postcondition for <em>S</em>, and therefore inherited postconditions include any stable property expressions for <em>S</em>.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0405-1"}</em>{"}"} In the case of a derived type <em>T</em>, when the preceding rules refer to "every primitive subprogram <em>S</em> of a type <em>T</em>", the referenced set of subprograms includes any inherited subprograms. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0405-1"}</em>{"}"} The equality operation that is used in the aforementioned equality expressions is as described in the case of an individual membership test whose <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0137">membership_choice</a></code> is a <em>choice_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0138">simple_expression</a></code> (see 4.5.2).</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0405-1"}</em>{"}"} The Post expression additions described above are enabled or disabled depending on the Post assertion policy that is in effect at the point of declaration of the subprogram <em>S</em>. A similar rule applies to the Post'Class expression additions. </p>
