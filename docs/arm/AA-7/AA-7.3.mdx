<p>[The declaration (in the visible part of a package) of a type as a private type or private extension serves to separate the characteristics that can be used directly by outside program units (that is, the logical properties) from other characteristics whose direct use is confined to the package (the details of the definition of the type itself). See <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.9#Subclause_3.9.1">3.9.1</a> for an overview of type extensions. ]<br /></p>


#### Language Design Principles

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
A private (untagged) type can be thought of as a record type with the type of its single (hidden) component being the full view.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
A private tagged type can be thought of as a private extension of an anonymous parent with no components. The only dispatching operation of the parent is equality (although the Size attribute, and, if nonlimited, assignment are allowed, and those will presumably be implemented in terms of dispatching). <br /></Admonition>

#### Legality Rules

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>A <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0232">private_type_declaration</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3#S0233">private_extension_declaration</a></code> declares a <em>partial view</em> of the type; such a declaration is allowed only as a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0087">declarative_item</a></code> of the visible part of a package, and it requires a completion, which shall be a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> that occurs as a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0087">declarative_item</a></code> of the private part of the package. [ The view of the type declared by the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> is called the <em>full view</em>.] A generic formal private type or a generic formal private extension is also a partial view. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>A private type can also be imported (using aspect Import, see <a href="../AA-B/AA-B.1">B.1</a>), in which case no completion is allowed, if supported by an implementation. <br /></Admonition>

Thus, neither the declaration of a variable of a partial view of a type, nor the creation by an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code> of an object of the partial view are allowed before the full declaration of the type.

<p>[A private type is limited if its declaration includes the reserved word <strong>limited</strong>; a private extension is limited if its ancestor type is a limited type that is not an interface type, or if the reserved word <strong>limited</strong> or <strong>synchronized</strong> appears in its definition.] If the partial view is nonlimited, then the full view shall be nonlimited.

<strong></strong>Note that deriving from a partial view within its immediate scope can only occur in a package that is a child of the one where the partial view is declared. The rule implies that in the visible part of a public child package, it is impossible to derive from an untagged private type declared in the visible part of the parent package in the case where the full view of the parent type turns out to be tagged. We considered a model in which the derived type was implicitly redeclared at the earliest place within its immediate scope where characteristics needed to be added. However, we rejected that model, because (1) it would imply that (for an untagged type) subprograms explicitly declared after the derived type could be inherited, and (2) to make this model work for composite types as well, several implicit redeclarations would be needed, since new characteristics can become visible one by one; that seemed like too much mechanism. <br /></Admonition>

This example is illegal because the completion of T1 is descended from an interface that the partial view is not descended from. If it were legal, T2 would implement Ifc twice, once in the visible part of P, and once in the visible part of P_Client. We would need to decide how Foo #1 and Foo #2 relate to each other.

<MarginText>7.z/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
If Foo #2 overrides Foo #1, we have a problem because the client redefines a behavior that it doesn't know about, and we try to avoid this at all costs, as it would lead to a breakdown of whatever abstraction was implemented. If the abstraction didn't expose that it implements Ifc, there must be a reason, and it should be able to depend on the fact that no overriding takes place in clients. Also, during maintenance, things may change and the full view might implement a different set of interfaces. Furthermore, the situation is even worse if the full type implements another interface Ifc2 that happens to have a conforming Foo (otherwise unrelated, except for its name and profile).<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
If Foo #2 doesn't override Foo #1, there is some similarity with the case of normal tagged private types, where a client can declare an operation that happens to conform to some private operation, and that's OK, it gets a different slot in the type descriptor. The problem here is that T2 would implement Ifc in two different ways, and through conversions to Ifc'Class we could end up with visibility on both of these two different implementations. This is the &ldquo;diamond inheritance&rdquo; problem of C++ all over again, and we would need some kind of a preference rule to pick one implementation. We don't want to go there (if we did, we might as well provide full-fledged multiple inheritance).<br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>This rule also prevents completing a private type with an interface. An interface, like all types, is a descendant of itself, and thus this rule is triggered.

In the original version of Ada 83, the same restriction applied to generic formal private types. However, the restriction was removed by the ARG for generics. In order to maintain the &ldquo;generic contract/private type contract analogy&rdquo; discussed above, we have to apply the same rule to package-private types.

Inherited subprograms are also implicitly declared immediately after the definition of the type, except as stated below.<br /></p>

<li>Invariant checks on subprogram return are not performed on objects that are accessible only through access-valued components of other objects.

For a type <em>T</em> that has a type invariant, avoiding the declaration of types with access-valued components designating objects with parts of <em>T</em> in the package that contains <em>T</em> is sufficient to prevent this leak.<br /></li>

<li>A client could call through an access-to-subprogram value and reach a subprogram body that has visibility on the full declaration of a type; no invariant checks will be performed if the designated subprogram is not itself a boundary subprogram.

<li>Invariant checks are only performed for parts of the nominal type for tagged parameters and function results. This means that components of extensions are not checked (these would be very expensive to check as any tagged type <em>might</em> have such an extension in the future, even though that would be very unlikely). For this leak to occur for a type <em>T</em> that has a type invariant, the body of a boundary entity of <em>T</em> needs to have visibility on a type extension that has components of <em>T</em> or access-to-<em>T</em> and also has an ancestor type (or class) as a parameter or result of the subprogram.<br /></li>

<li>Invariant checks are not performed for parts of incomplete types when the completion is not available.

Outside of package <em>P</em>, there are declarations of an instantiation <em>I1</em> of <em>P.G1</em> and an instantiation <em>I2</em> of <em>I1.G2</em>. <em>I2</em> can declare visible subprograms whose bodies see the full view of <em>T</em> and yet these subprograms are not boundary subprograms (because the generic <em>I1.G2</em> is not declared within the immediate scope of <em>T</em> - <em>G1.G2</em> is, but that's irrelevant). So a call to one of these subprograms from outside of <em>P</em> could yield an invariant-violating value.

<strong></strong>Null procedures and abstract subprograms are excluded as they do not allow specific postconditions. Moreover, for null procedures, static analysis tools can be certain that their parameters aren't modified so there is no need to assert that the properties don't change.

<p>For every primitive subprogram <em>S</em> of a type <em>T</em>, the class-wide postcondition expression of <em>S</em> is modified to include expressions of the form <em>F</em>(<em>P</em>) = <em>F</em>(<em>P</em>)'Old, all <strong>and</strong>ed with each other and any explicit class-wide postcondition expression, with one such equality included for each class-wide stable property function <em>F</em> of <em>S</em> for type <em>T</em> that does not occur in any class-wide postcondition expression that applies to <em>S</em>, and <em>P</em> is each parameter of <em>S</em> that has type <em>T</em> and is not excluded from stable property checks. The resulting class-wide postcondition expression of <em>S</em> is used in place of the explicit class-wide postcondition expression of <em>S</em> [when interpreting the meaning of the postcondition as defined in <a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#Subclause_6.1.1">6.1.1</a>].<br /></p>

<strong></strong>We suppress stable property expressions if the property function appears in the explicit class-wide postcondition, or in any inherited class-wide postconditions. If we didn't do that, we could have conflicting requirements in an inherited postcondition and the current one. We also avoid redundant property checks. <br /></Admonition>
