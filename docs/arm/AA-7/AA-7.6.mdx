<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>[ Three kinds of actions are fundamental to the manipulation of objects: initialization, finalization, and assignment. Every object is initialized, either explicitly or by default, after being created (for example, by an <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.3#S0032">object_declaration</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code>). Every object is finalized before being destroyed (for example, by leaving a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.3#S0216">subprogram_body</a></code> containing an <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.3#S0032">object_declaration</a></code>, or by a call to an instance of Unchecked_Deallocation). An assignment operation is used as part of <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.2#S0173">assignment_statement</a></code>s, explicit initialization, parameter passing, and other operations. <br /></p>

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>Default definitions for these three fundamental operations are provided by the language, but a <em>controlled</em> type gives the user additional control over parts of these operations. In particular, the user can define, for a controlled type, an Initialize procedure which is invoked immediately after the normal default initialization of a controlled object, a Finalize procedure which is invoked immediately before finalization of any of the components of a controlled object, and an Adjust procedure which is invoked as the last step of an assignment to a (nonlimited) controlled object.] <br /></p>

<strong></strong>A controlled type supports user-defined assignment and finalization. Objects are always finalized before being destroyed.<br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00114-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00287-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Here's the basic idea of initialization, value adjustment, and finalization, whether or not user defined: When an object is created, if it is explicitly assigned an initial value, the object is either built-in-place from an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.3#S0106">aggregate</a></code> or function call (in which case neither Adjust nor Initialize is applied), or the assignment copies and adjusts the initial value. Otherwise, Initialize is applied to it (except in the case of an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.3#S0106">aggregate</a></code> as a whole). An <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.2#S0173">assignment_statement</a></code> finalizes the target before copying in and adjusting the new value. Whenever an object goes away, it is finalized. Calls on Initialize and Adjust happen bottom-up; that is, components first, followed by the containing object. Calls on Finalize happen top-down; that is, first the containing object, and then its components. These ordering rules ensure that any components will be in a well-defined state when Initialize, Adjust, or Finalize is applied to the containing object. <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00348-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />A controlled type is a descendant of Controlled or Limited_Controlled. The predefined "=" operator of type Controlled always returns True, [since this operator is incorporated into the implementation of the predefined equality operator of types derived from Controlled, as explained in <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5#Subclause_4.5.2">4.5.2</a>.] The type Limited_Controlled is like Controlled, except that it is limited and it lacks the primitive subprogram Adjust. <br /></p>

<MarginText>10.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>We say &ldquo;nonlimited controlled type&rdquo; (rather than just &ldquo;controlled type&rdquo;;) when we want to talk about descendants of Controlled only. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>10.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>We considered making Adjust and Finalize abstract. However, a reasonable coding convention is e.g. for Finalize to always call the parent's Finalize after doing whatever work is needed for the extension part. (Unlike CLOS, we have no way to do that automatically in Ada 95.) For this to work, Finalize cannot be abstract. In a generic unit, for a generic formal abstract derived type whose ancestor is Controlled or Limited_Controlled, calling the ancestor's Finalize would be illegal if it were abstract, even though the actual type might have a concrete version.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>10.c</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Types Controlled and Limited_Controlled are abstract, even though they have no abstract primitive subprograms. It is not clear that they need to be abstract, but there seems to be no harm in it, and it might make an implementation's life easier to know that there are no objects of these types &mdash; in case the implementation wishes to make them &ldquo;magic&rdquo; in some way.<br /></Admonition>

{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00251-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />For Ada 2005, we considered making these types interfaces. That would have the advantage of allowing them to be added to existing trees. But that was rejected both because it would cause massive disruptions to existing implementations, and because it would be very incompatible due to the "no hidden interfaces" rule. The latter rule would prevent a tagged private type from being completed with a derivation from Controlled or Limited_Controlled &mdash; a very common idiom. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>13</MarginText>
<p>Initialize and other initialization operations are done in an arbitrary order, except as follows. Initialize is applied to an object after initialization of its subcomponents, if any [(including both implicit initialization and Initialize calls)]. If an object has a component with an access discriminant constrained by a per-object expression, Initialize is applied to this component after any components that do not have such discriminants. For an object with several components with such a discriminant, Initialize is applied to them in order of their <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.8#S0070">component_declaration</a></code>s.

The fact that Initialize is done for components with access discriminants after other components allows the Initialize operation for a component with a self-referential access discriminant to assume that other components of the enclosing object have already been properly initialized.

<MarginText>14</MarginText>
<p>When a target object with any controlled parts is assigned a value, [either when created or in a subsequent <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.2#S0173">assignment_statement</a></code>,] the <em>assignment operation</em> proceeds as follows: <br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0067-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />To adjust the value of a composite object, the values of the components of the object are first adjusted in an arbitrary order, and then, if the object is nonlimited controlled, Adjust is called.

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0067-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Adjustment is never actually performed for values of an immutably limited type, since all assignment operations for such types are required to be built-in-place.

<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The verbiage in the Initialize rule about access discriminants constrained by per-object expressions is not necessary here, since such types are either limited or do not have defaults, so the discriminant can only be changed by an assignment to an outer object. Such an assignment could happen only before any adjustments or (if part of an outer Adjust) only after any inner (component) adjustments have completed. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>18</MarginText>
<p>For an <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.2#S0173">assignment_statement</a></code>, [ after the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> and <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> have been evaluated, and any conversion (including constraint checking) has been done,] an anonymous object is created, and the value is assigned into it; [that is, the assignment operation is applied]. [(Assignment includes value adjustment.)] The target of the <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.2#S0173">assignment_statement</a></code> is then finalized. The value of the anonymous object is then assigned into the target of the <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.2#S0173">assignment_statement</a></code>. Finally, the anonymous object is finalized.

Assign (or ":=") would have the responsibility of doing the copy, as well as whatever else is necessary.

However, this sort of design would not work in the case of unconstrained discriminated variables, because there is no way to change the discriminants individually. For example: <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>18.f</MarginText>

<strong>To be honest: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />This &ldquo;mutating&rdquo; does not necessarily happen atomically with respect to abort and other tasks. For example, if a function call is used as the ancestor  part of an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.3#S0111">extension_aggregate</a></code>, then the tag of the anonymous object (the function result) will be different from the tag of the newly-created object (the ancestor  part of the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.3#S0111">extension_aggregate</a></code>). In implementation terms, this involves modifying the tag field. If the current task is aborted during this modification, the object might become abnormal. Likewise, if some other task accesses the tag field during this modification, it constitutes improper use of shared variables, and is erroneous. <br /></Admonition>

For a function call, if the size of the newly-created object is known at the call site, the object is allocated there, and the address is implicitly passed to the function; the return object is created at that address. Otherwise, a storage pool is implicitly passed to the function; the size is determined at the point of the return statement, and passed to the Allocate procedure. The address returned by the storage pool is returned from the function, and the newly-created object uses that same address. If the return statement is left without returning (via an exception or a goto, for example), then Deallocate is called.  The storage pool might be a dummy pool that represents &ldquo;allocate on the stack&rdquo;.<br /></Admonition>

{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00280-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />We define <em>finalization of the collection</em> here, so as to be able to conveniently refer to it in other rules (especially in <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8">4.8</a>, &ldquo;<a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8">Allocators</a>&rdquo;).<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00416-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Clarified that a coextension is finalized at the same time as the outer object. (This was intended for Ada 95, but since the concept did not have a name, it was overlooked.) <br /></Admonition>


#### Inconsistencies With Ada 2005

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0051-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0190-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Better defined when objects allocated from anonymous access types are finalized. This could be inconsistent if objects are finalized in a different order than in an Ada 2005 implementation and that order caused different program behavior; however programs that depend on the order of finalization within a single master are already fragile and hopefully are rare. <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2005

<MarginText>25.dd/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0064-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0064-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Removed a redundant rule, which is now covered by the additional places where masters are defined.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>25.ee/4</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0099-1", "AI12-0005-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0099-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Clarified the finalization rules so that there is no doubt that privacy is ignored, and to ensure that objects of class-wide interface types are finalized based on their specific concrete type.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>25.ff/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0107-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0107-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Allowed premature finalization of parts of failed <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code>s. This could be an inconsistency, but the previous behavior is still allowed and there is no requirement that implementations take advantage of the permission.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>25.gg/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0111-3"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0111-3"}</em>{"}"} <br />Added a permission to finalize an object allocated from a subpool later than usual.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>25.hh/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0142-4"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0142-4"}</em>{"}"} <br />Added text to specially define the master of anonymous objects which are passed as explicitly aliased parameters (see <a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1">6.1</a>) of functions. The model for these parameters is explained in detail in <a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#Subclause_6.4.1">6.4.1</a>. <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2012

<MarginText>25.ii/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0406-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0406-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Defined the term &ldquo;master construct&rdquo;, so as to put static accessibility rules on a firmer basis, including ensuring that those rules apply inside of generic bodies. <br /></Admonition>
