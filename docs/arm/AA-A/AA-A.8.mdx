#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>1/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00283-01"]} />
<p>Two kinds of access to external files are defined in this subclause: <em>sequential access</em> and <em>direct access</em>. The corresponding file types and the associated operations are provided by the generic packages Sequential_IO and Direct_IO. A file object to be used for sequential access is called a <em>sequential file</em>, and one to be used for direct access is called a <em>direct file</em>. Access to <em>stream file</em>s is described in <a href="../AA-A/AA-A.12#Subclause_A.12.1">A.12.1</a>.<br /></p>

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>For sequential access, the file is viewed as a sequence of values that are transferred in the order of their appearance (as produced by the program or by the external environment). When the file is opened with mode In_File or Out_File, transfer starts respectively from or to the beginning of the file. When the file is opened with mode Append_File, transfer to the file starts after the last element of the file. <br /></p>

<MarginText>2.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<strong></strong>Adding stream I/O necessitates a review of the terminology. In Ada 83, `sequential' implies both the access method (purely sequential &mdash; that is, no indexing or positional access) and homogeneity. Direct access includes purely sequential access and indexed access, as well as homogeneity. In Ada 95, streams allow purely sequential access but also positional access to an individual element, and are heterogeneous. We considered generalizing the notion of `sequential file' to include both Sequential_IO and Stream_IO files, but since streams allow positional access it seems misleading to call them sequential files. Or, looked at differently, if the criterion for calling something a sequential file is whether it permits (versus requires) purely sequential access, then one could just as soon regard a Direct_IO file as a sequential file.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>2.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
It seems better to regard `sequential file' as meaning `only permitting purely sequential access'; hence we have decided to supplement `sequential access' and `direct access' with a third category, informally called `access to streams'. (We decided against the term `stream access' because of possible confusion with the Stream_Access type declared in one of the stream packages.)<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>For direct access, the file is viewed as a set of elements occupying consecutive positions in linear order; a value can be transferred to or from an element of the file at any selected position. The position of an element is specified by its <em>index</em>, which is a number, greater than zero, of the implementation-defined integer type Count. The first element, if any, has index one; the index of the last element, if any, is called the <em>current size</em>; the current size is zero if there are no elements. The current size is a property of the external file.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>An open direct file has a <em>current index</em>, which is the index that will be used by the next read or write operation. When a direct file is opened, the current index is set to one. The current index of a direct file is a property of a file object, not of an external file. <br /></p>

## A.8.2  File Management


#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>The procedures and functions described in this subclause provide for the control of external files; their declarations are repeated in each of the packages for sequential, direct, text, and stream input-output. For text input-output, the procedures Create, Open, and Reset have additional effects described in subclause <a href="../AA-A/AA-A.10#Subclause_A.10.2">A.10.2</a>. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>We considered basing Sequential_IO.Read on Element_Type'Read from an implicit stream associated with the sequential file. However, Element_Type'Read is a type-related attribute, whereas Sequential_IO should take advantage of the particular constraints of the actual subtype corresponding to Element_Type to minimize the size of the external file. Furthermore, forcing the implementation of Sequential_IO to be based on Element_Type'Read would create an upward incompatibility since existing data files written by an Ada 83 program using Sequential_IO might not be readable by the identical program built with an Ada 95 implementation of Sequential_IO.<br /></Admonition>

An Ada 95 implementation might still use an implementation-defined attribute analogous to 'Read to implement the procedure Read, but that attribute will likely have to be subtype-specific rather than type-related, and it need not be user-specifiable. Such an attribute will presumably be needed to implement the generic package Storage_IO (see <a href="../AA-A/AA-A.9">A.9</a>). <br /></Admonition>
