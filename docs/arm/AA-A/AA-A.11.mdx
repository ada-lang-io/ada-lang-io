<p>The packages Wide{"_"}Text{"_"}IO and Wide{"_"}Wide{"_"}Text{"_"}IO provide facilities for input and output in human-readable form. Each file is read or written sequentially, as a sequence of wide characters (or wide wide characters) grouped into lines, and as a sequence of lines grouped into pages. <br /></p>

Nongeneric equivalents of Wide{"_"}Text{"_"}IO.Integer{"_"}IO and Wide{"_"}Text{"_"}IO.Float{"_"}IO are provided (as for Text{"_"}IO) for each predefined numeric type, with names such as Ada.Integer{"_"}Wide{"_"}Text{"_"}IO, Ada.Long{"_"}Integer{"_"}Wide{"_"}Text{"_"}IO, Ada.Float{"_"}Wide{"_"}Text{"_"}IO, Ada.Long{"_"}Float{"_"}Wide{"_"}Text{"_"}IO.<br /></p>
