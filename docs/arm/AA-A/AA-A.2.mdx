#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>The following language-defined library package exists: <br /></p>

<MarginText>2/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0414-1"]} />
<CodeBlock language="ada">
package Ada{"\n"}   with Pure is{"\n"}end Ada;{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<MarginText>3/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0414-1"]} />
<p>Ada serves as the parent of most of the other language-defined library units; its declaration is empty. <br /></p>


#### Legality Rules

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>In the standard mode, it is illegal to compile a child of package Ada. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<b></b>The intention is that mentioning, say, Ada.Text{"_"}IO in a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-10/AA-10.1#S0294">with_clause</a></code> is guaranteed (at least in the standard mode) to refer to the standard version of Ada.Text{"_"}IO. The user can compile a root library unit Text{"_"}IO that has no relation to the standard version of Text{"_"}IO. <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<b></b>Note that Ada can have non-language-defined grandchildren, assuming the implementation allows it. Also, packages System and Interfaces can have children, assuming the implementation allows it. <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.c</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note">
<b></b>An implementation will typically support a nonstandard mode in which compiling the language defined library units is allowed. Whether or not this mode is made available to users is up to the implementer.<br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.d</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
An implementation could theoretically have private children of Ada, since that would be semantically neutral. However, a programmer cannot compile such a library unit. <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>

#### Extensions to Ada 83

</AnnotatedOnly>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.e/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0299-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
This subclause is new to Ada 95. <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>
