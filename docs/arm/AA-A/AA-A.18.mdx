<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00302-03"}</em>{"}"} <br />This clause presents the specifications of the package Containers and several child packages, which provide facilities for storing collections of elements.<br /></p>

<MarginText>1.a.1/3</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A container is an object that contain other objects all of the same type, which could be class-wide. Several predefined container types are provided by the children of package Ada.Containers (see <a href="../AA-A/AA-A.18#Subclause_A.18.1">A.18.1</a>).<br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00302-03"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0196-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0416-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />A variety of sequence and associative containers are provided. Each container package defines  a <em>cursor</em> type as well as a container type. A cursor is a reference to an element within a container. Many operations on cursors are common to all of the containers. A cursor referencing an element in a container is considered to be overlapping only with the element  itself. <br /></p>

<MarginText>3.a/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0005-1", "AI12-0196-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0196-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The last sentence is intended to clarify that operations that just use a cursor do not interfere if the cursor objects designated different elements of the container  in terms of the concurrent call  rules of <a href="../AA-A/">Annex A</a>. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>3.b/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0196-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0196-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />A cursor is not considered to overlap with other elements of the associated container, thus parallel operations involving a set of cursors each operating on mutually exclusive sets of elements from the same container are expected to work. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>3.c/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0416-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0416-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />We use the term &ldquo;container&rdquo; alone when it is clear from context what kind of entity (package, type, or object) that we are talking about. Otherwise, we use &ldquo;container package&rdquo;, &ldquo;container type&rdquo;, or &ldquo;container object&rdquo;. Note that "container type" is defined in <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.3#Subclause_4.3.5">4.3.5</a> for a different usage; in all of <a href="../AA-A/AA-A.18">A.18</a> we mean &ldquo;container type&rdquo; to be one of the primary types declared in the child packages of package Containers, such as Vector, List, or Map. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>3.1/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0111-1", "AI12-0439-1"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0111-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0439-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Some operations of the language-defined child units of Ada.Containers have access-to-subprogram parameters. To ensure such operations are well-defined, they guard against certain actions by the designated subprogram. An action on a container that can add or remove an element is considered to <em>tamper with cursors</em>, and these are prohibited during all such operations. An action on a container that can replace an element with one of a different size is considered to <em>tamper with elements</em>, and these are prohibited during certain of such operations. The details of the specific actions that are considered to tamper with cursors or elements are defined for each child unit of Ada.Containers.<br /></p>

<MarginText>3.2/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0111-1"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0111-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Several of the language-defined child units of Ada.Containers include a nested package named Stable, which provides a view of a container that prohibits any operations that would tamper with elements. By using a Stable view for manipulating a container, the number of tampering checks performed while performing the operations can be reduced. The details of the Stable subpackage are defined separately for each child unit of Ada.Containers that includes such a nested package.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00302-03"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00302-03"}</em>{"}"} <br />Within this clause we provide <em>O</em>(X). Presuming f is some function of a length parameter N and t(N) is the time the operation takes (on average or worst case, as specified) for the length N, a complexity of <em>O</em>(f(N)) means that there exists a finite A such that for any N, t(N)/f(N) {"<"} A. <br /></p>

<MarginText>4.a/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>Of course, an implementation can do better than a specified <em>O</em>(f(N)): for example, <em>O</em>(1) meets the requirements for <em>O</em>(log N).<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>4.b/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
This concept seems to have as many names as there are authors. We used &ldquo;Landau symbol&rdquo; because that's what our reference does. But we'd also seen this referred as big-O notation (sometimes written as <em>big-oh</em>), and as Bachmann notation. Whatever the name, it always has the above definition. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>5/2</MarginText>
<p>If the advice suggests that the complexity should be less than <em>O</em>(f(N)), then for any arbitrarily small positive real D, there should exist a positive integer M such that for all N {">"} M, t(N)/f(N) {"<"} D.<br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0001-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0044-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0416-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />When a formal function is used to provide an ordering for a container, it is generally required to define a strict weak ordering. A function "{"<"}" defines a <em>strict weak ordering</em> if it is irreflexive, asymmetric, transitive, and in addition, if <em>x</em> {"<"} <em>y</em> for any values <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, then for all other values <em>z</em>, (<em>x</em> {"<"} <em>z</em>) or (<em>z</em> {"<"} <em>y</em>). Elements are in a <em>smallest first</em> order using such an operator if, for every element <em>y</em> with a predecessor <em>x</em> in the order, (<em>y</em> {"<"} <em>x</em>) is false.<br /></p>

<MarginText>6.a.1/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0416-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0416-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Given a "{"<"}" operator that provides a strict weak ordering, knowing that (<em>y</em> {"<"} <em>x</em>) is false is enough to know that (<em>x</em> {"<"}= <em>y</em>) is true. For a strict weak ordering, (<em>x</em> = <em>y</em>) when both (<em>x</em> {"<"} <em>y</em>) and (<em>y</em> {"<"} <em>x</em>) are false. Therefore, it is not necessary to use the "=" operator or test (<em>x</em> {"<"} <em>y</em>). We only need to discuss adjacent elements since a strict weak ordering is transitive. <br /></Admonition>


#### Language Design Principles

<MarginText>6.a/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00302-03", "AI05-0299-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00302-03"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />This subclause provides a number of useful containers for Ada. Only the most useful containers are provided. Ones that are relatively easy to code, redundant, or rarely used are omitted from this set, even if they are generally included in containers libraries.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.b/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The containers packages are modeled on the Standard Template Library (STL), an algorithms and data structure library popularized by Alexander Stepanov, and included in the C++ standard library. The structure and terminology differ from the STL where that better maps to common Ada usage. For instance, what the STL calls &ldquo;iterators&rdquo; are called &ldquo;cursors&rdquo; here.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.c/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The following major nonlimited containers are provided:<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.d/2</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>(Expandable) Vectors of any nonlimited type;<br /></li>
<MarginText>6.e/2</MarginText>
<li>Doubly-linked Lists of any nonlimited type;<br /></li>

<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0136-1"]} />
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0136-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Multiway Trees of any nonlimited type;<br /></li>
<MarginText>6.i.2/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0069-1"]} />
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0069-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Holders of any (indefinite) nonlimited type;<br /></li>
<MarginText>6.i.3/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0159-1"]} />
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0159-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Synchronized queues of any definite nonlimited type; and<br /></li>

<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0159-1"]} />
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0159-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Priority queues of any definite nonlimited type. <br /></li>
</ul>
<MarginText>6.j/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0001-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0001-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Separate versions for definite and indefinite element types are provided, as those for definite types can be implemented more efficiently. Similarly, a separate bounded version is provided in order to give more predictable memory usage.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.k/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Each container includes a cursor, which is a reference to an element within a container. Cursors generally remain valid as long as the container exists and the element referenced is not deleted. Many operations on cursors are common to all of the containers. This makes it possible to write generic algorithms that work on any kind of container.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.l/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The containers packages are structured so that additional packages can be added in the future. Indeed, we hope that these packages provide the basis for a more extensive secondary standard for containers.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.m/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
If containers with similar functionality (but different performance characteristics) are provided (by the implementation or by a secondary standard), we suggest that a prefix be used to identify the class of the functionality: "Ada.Containers.Bounded_Sets" (for a set with a maximum number of elements); "Ada.Containers.Protected_Maps" (for a map which can be accessed by multiple tasks at one time); "Ada.Containers.Persistent_Vectors" (for a persistent vector which continues to exist between executions of a program) and so on.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.n/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Note that the language already includes several requirements that are important to the use of containers. These include:<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.o/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0196-1"]} />
<ul>
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0196-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Library packages must allow concurrent calls  &ndash; multiple tasks can use the packages as long as they operate on separate containers. Thus, it is only necessary for a user to protect a container if a single container needs to be used by multiple tasks and concurrent calls to operations of the container have overlapping parameters.<br /></li>
<MarginText>6.p/2</MarginText>
<li>Language-defined types must stream "properly". That means that the stream attributes can be used to implement persistence of containers when necessary, and containers can be passed between partitions of a program.<br /></li>
<MarginText>6.q/2</MarginText>
<li>Equality of language-defined types must compose &ldquo;properly&rdquo;. This means that the version of "=" directly used by users is the same one that will be used in generics and in predefined equality operators of types with components of the containers and/or cursors. This prevents the abstraction from breaking unexpectedly.<br /></li>
<MarginText>6.q.1/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0048-1"]} />
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0048-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Redispatching is not allowed (unless it is required). That means that overriding a container operation will not change the behavior of any other predefined container operation. This provides a stable base for extensions. <br /></li>
</ul>
<MarginText>6.r/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0258-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0258-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />If a container's element type is controlled, the point at which the element is finalized will depend on the implementation of the container. For certain kinds of containers, we require finalization behavior based on the canonical implementation of the container (see the Implementation Requirements below). For the "normal" containers, we  do not specify precisely where this will happen (it will happen no later than the finalization of the container, of course) in order to give implementations flexibility to cache, block,  split , or reusethe nodes of the container. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.s/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0258-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<em>This paragraph was deleted.</em>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0258-1"}</em>{"}"}  <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.t/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The use of controlled types also brings up the possibility of failure of finalization (and thus deallocation) of an element. This is a &ldquo;serious bug&rdquo;, as AI95-179 puts it, so we don't try to specify what happens in that case. The implementation should propagate the exception. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.u/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>It is expected that exceptions propagated from these operations do not damage containers. That is, if Storage_Error is propagated because of an allocation failure, or Constraint_Error is propagated by the assignment of elements, the container can continue to be used without further exceptions. The intent is that it should be possible to recover from errors without losing data. We don't try to state this formally in most cases, because it is hard to define precisely what is and is not allowed behavior. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>6.v/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0005-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />When this clause says that the behavior of something is unspecified, we really mean that any result of executing Ada code short of erroneous execution is allowed. We do not mean that memory not belonging to the parameters of the operation can be trashed. When we mean to allow erroneous behavior, we specifically say that execution is erroneous. All this means that, if the containers are written in Ada,  checks should not be suppressed or removed assuming some behavior of other code, and that the implementation should take care to avoid creating internal dangling accesses by assuming behavior from generic formals that can't be guaranteed. We don't try to say this normatively because it would be fairly complex, and implementers are unlikely to increase their support costs by fielding implementations that are unstable if given buggy hash functions, et al. <br /></Admonition>


#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>7/4</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0035-1"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0035-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Certain subprograms declared within instances of some of the generic packages presented in this clause are said to <em>perform indefinite insertion</em>. These subprograms are those corresponding (in the sense of the copying described in subclause <a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3">12.3</a>) to subprograms that have formal parameters of a generic formal indefinite type and that are identified as performing indefinite insertion in the subclause defining the generic package.<br /></p>

<MarginText>8/4</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0035-1"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0035-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />If a subprogram performs indefinite insertion, then certain run-time checks are performed as part of a call to the subprogram; if any of these checks fail, then the resulting exception is propagated to the caller and the container is not modified by the call. These checks are performed for each parameter corresponding (in the sense of the copying described in <a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3">12.3</a>) to a parameter in the corresponding generic whose type is a generic formal indefinite type. The checks performed for a given parameter are those checks explicitly specified in subclause <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8">4.8</a> that would be performed as part of the evaluation of an initialized allocator whose access type is declared immediately within the instance, where:<br /></p>

<MarginText>9/4</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>the value of the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.7#S0163">qualified_expression</a></code> is that of the parameter; and<br /></li>
<MarginText>10/4</MarginText>
<li>the designated subtype of the access type is the subtype of the parameter; and<br /></li>
<MarginText>11/4</MarginText>
<li>finalization of the collection of the access type has started if and only if the finalization of the instance has started. <br /></li>
</ul>
<MarginText>11.a/4</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>The phrase "explicitly specified" means those checks for which subclause <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8">4.8</a> includes the phrase "{"<"}some exception{">"} is raised if ...". It does not refer, for example, to any checks performed as part of any subtype conversion. In particular, this wording includes the checks described in subclause <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8">4.8</a> to be performed in the case of a class-wide designated type, and of a designated subtype that has access discriminant parts. These checks are needed to prevent containers from outliving their contained (Element_Type or Key_Type) values. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>11.b/4</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>These rules have a dual purpose. Mainly, we are <em>requiring</em> checks needed to prevent dangling references. As a side effect, we are also <em>allowing</em> checks needed to permit an implementation of a container generic to make use of access types in a straightforward way. As an example of the second purpose, suppose that an implementation does declare such an access type and suppose further that the finalization of the collection of the access type has started. These rules allow Program_Error to be propagated in this case (as specified in <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8">4.8</a>); this is necessary to allow an all-Ada implementation of these packages. <br /></Admonition>


#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>12/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0258-1"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0258-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />For an indefinite container (one whose type is defined in an instance of a child package of Containers whose <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.1#S0022">defining_identifier</a></code> contains "Indefinite"), each element of the container shall be created when it is inserted into the container and finalized when it is deleted from the container (or when the container object is finalized if the element has not been deleted). For a bounded container (one whose type is defined in an instance of a child package of Containers whose <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.1#S0022">defining_identifier</a></code> starts with "Bounded") that is not an indefinite container, all of the elements of the capacity of the container shall be created and default initialized when the container object is created; the elements shall be finalized when the container object is finalized. [For other kinds of containers, when elements are created and finalized is unspecified.]<br /></p>

<MarginText>12.a/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>This allows a user to be able to reason about the behavior of elements that have controlled parts. In most cases, such elements need to be stored in an indefinite container. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>12.b/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>If the containers are implemented in Ada, this implies that elements for an indefinite container are allocated individually, and that a bounded container contains an array of elements or other data structure that is initialized for the entire capacity of the container when it is created. There is no such restriction on the implementation of the "normal" containers; these can be handled in any way convenient to the implementation &mdash; in particular, node reuse is allowed. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>13/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0112-1"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0112-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />For an instance <em>I</em> of a container package with a container type, the specific type <em>T</em> of the object returned from a function that returns an object of an iterator interface, as well as the primitive operations of <em>T</em>, shall be nonblocking. The Global aspect specified for <em>T</em> and the primitive operations of <em>T</em> shall be (<strong>in all</strong>, <strong>out synchronized</strong>) or a specification that allows access to fewer global objects.<br /></p>

<MarginText>13.a/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>This requires that the traversal and iteration operations of a container do not create, destroy, or assign any objects of a formal type of <em>I</em>, nor call any formal subprograms of <em>I</em>. Those objects and subprograms might be blocking (depending on the actual parameters). We put similar requirements on the individual traversal operations in the container package definitions. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>13.b/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>These requirements allows users to use container iterators inside of parallel constructs, regardless of the actual parameters to the instantiation. If such an iterator allowed blocking, it would be illegal inside of a parallel construct (see <a href="../AA-9/AA-9.5">9.5</a>). If such an iterator allowed writing of unsynchronized global objects, it would be illegal when the default conflict checking policy is in effect (see <a href="../AA-9/AA-9.10#Subclause_9.10.1">9.10.1</a>). These requirements include sequential iterators; the iterator does not need to appear in a parallel loop to trigger these requirements. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>13.c/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>We have to give these requirements as a text rule, as there is no place to declare suitable aspects. The specific type of a container iterator is declared by the implementation and is not part of the visible specification (iterator functions just return a value of a class-wide type). The iterator interface itself cannot impose such a requirement since it needs to be able to work with user-defined types that do need to allow blocking. We give this as a global requirement to avoid duplication. <br /></Admonition>

## A.18.2  The Generic Package Containers.Vectors

<MarginText>1/2</MarginText>
<p>The language-defined generic package Containers.Vectors provides private types Vector and Cursor, and a set of operations for each type. A vector container allows insertion and deletion at any position, but it is specifically optimized for insertion and deletion at the high end (the end with the higher index) of the container. A vector container also provides random access to its elements. <br /></p>

<MarginText>2/2</MarginText>
<p>A vector container behaves conceptually as an array that expands as necessary as items are inserted. The <em>length</em> of a vector is the number of elements that the vector contains. The <em>capacity</em> of a vector is the maximum number of elements that can be inserted into the vector prior to it being automatically expanded.<br /></p>

<MarginText>3/2</MarginText>
<p>Elements in a vector container can be referred to by an index value of a generic formal type. The first element of a vector always has its index value equal to the lower bound of the formal type.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4/2</MarginText>
<p>A vector container may contain <em>empty elements</em>. Empty elements do not have a specified value.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4.a/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>Vectors are not intended to be sparse (that is, there are elements at all defined positions). Users are expected to use other containers (like a Map) when they need sparse structures (there is a Note to this effect at the end of this subclause).<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>4.b/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The internal array is a conceptual model of a vector. There is no requirement for an implementation to be a single contiguous array. <br /></Admonition>

{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0111-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Tampering with elements is now defined to be equivalent to tampering with cursors for ordinary containers. If a program requires tampering detection to work, it might fail in Ada 2022. Specifically, if a program requires Program_Error to be raised by a routine that (only) tampers with elements in Ada 2012 (such as Replace_Element) when called in a context that does not allow tampering with elements (such as Update_Element), the routine will work as defined instead of raising Program_Error in Ada 2022. Needless to say, this shouldn't happen outside of test programs. Note that such contexts still prohibit tampering with cursors, so routines like Insert and Delete will still raise Program_Error in this case.<br /></Admonition>

This introduces a potential incompatibility for overloaded routines, including the "&" operations defined in this package. If the Element_Type of the vector is a type that allows aggregates (such as a record type), then calls to the "&" operations with an aggregate element will become ambiguous in Ada 2022, while they would have been legal in Ada 2012.

The counter is initialized to zero, and is incremented when tampering is prohibited, and decremented when leaving an area that prohibited tampering. Function Tampering_With_Cursors_Prohibited returns True if the counter is nonzero. (Note that any case where the result is not well-defined for one task is incorrect use of shared variables and would be erroneous by the rules of <a href="../AA-9/AA-9.10">9.10</a>, so no special protection is needed to read the counter.) <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0022-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0248-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />It is a bounded error for the actual function associated with a generic formal subprogram, when called as part of an operation of a map package, to tamper with elements of any map parameter of the operation. Either Program_Error is raised, or the operation works as defined on the value of the map either prior to, or subsequent to, some or all of the modifications to the map.<br /></p>

<MarginText>75.8/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0027-1"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0027-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />It is a bounded error to call any subprogram declared in the visible part of a map package when the associated container has been finalized. If the operation takes Container as an <strong>in out</strong> parameter, then it raises Constraint_Error or Program_Error. Otherwise, the operation either proceeds as it would for an empty container, or it raises Constraint_Error or Program_Error. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>Each object of Reference_Type and Constant_Reference_Type probably contains some reference to the originating container.

This is a normal case of a dangling pointer created by Unchecked_Deallocation; we have to explicitly mention it here as the pointer in question is not visible in the specification of the type. (This is the same reason we have to say this for invalid cursors.) <br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>We do not mean to overly constrain implementation strategies here.

<strong></strong>We do not mean to overly constrain implementation strategies here.

But note that only the result of "=" for Set objects is unspecified; other subprograms are not allowed to break if "=" is bad (they aren't expected to use "="). <br /></Admonition>

Each element except for the last element has a <em>successor element</em>. If there are no other intervening operations, starting with the first element and repeatedly going to the successor element will visit each element in the set exactly once until the last element is reached.

{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0112-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />These inclusions mean that there are no operations that would tamper with elements that do not tamper with cursors. As such, we do not define tampering with elements at all for set containers. Earlier versions of Ada did so just so the description of subprograms are the same between containers, but since we've changed those to pre- and postconditions which are necessarily specific to each container, there no longer seems to be any reason to define tampering with elements for sets. <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0022-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0248-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />It is a bounded error for the actual function associated with a generic formal subprogram, when called as part of an operation of a set package, to tamper with elements of any set parameter of the operation. Either Program_Error is raised, or the operation works as defined on the value of the set either prior to, or subsequent to, some or all of the modifications to the set.<br /></p>

If the operation takes Container as an <strong>in out</strong> parameter, then it raises Constraint_Error or Program_Error. Otherwise, the operation either proceeds as it would for an empty container, or it raises Constraint_Error or Program_Error. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0112-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />When this function is true, the Position can be meaningfully used with operations for Container. We define this because many operations allow the root (which does not have an element, so Has_Element returns False), so many preconditions get unwieldy. We allow No_Element as it is allowed by many queries, and for existing routines, it raises a different exception (Constraint_Error rather than Program_Error) than a cursor for the wrong container does. <br /></Admonition>

This means that no reasonable program can tell how many times Equal_Subtree is called, and thus an implementation can call it as many or as few times as it needs to get the correct answer. Specifically, there is no requirement to call the formal equality or Equal_Subtree additional times once the answer has been determined. <br /></Admonition>

Moreover, it is possible for tampering to be prohibited by multiple operations (sequentially or in parallel). Therefore, tampering needs to be implemented with an atomic or protected counter. The counter is initialized to zero, and is incremented when tampering is prohibited, and decremented when leaving an area that prohibited tampering. Function Tampering_With_Cursors_Prohibited returns True if the counter is nonzero. (Note that any case where the result is not well-defined for one task is incorrect use of shared variables and would be erroneous by the rules of <a href="../AA-9/AA-9.10">9.10</a>, so no special protection is needed to read the counter.) <br /></Admonition>

This means that tampering with elements is prohibited during the entire loop, rather than tampering with cursors being prohibited during the loop, and tampering with elements being prohibited only during the lifetimes of references to the loop parameter. Thus, if a container element iterator does an operation that tampers with elements on the iterated container, that operation will fail a tampering check in Ada 2022 (and thus raise Program_Error), while it would have worked in Ada 2012 so long as the loop parameter is not involved. We believe this to be a dubious loop structure that should be rare. Note that this issue only occurs for the indefinite container form, the ordinary and bounded containers allow such operations at any time in Ada 2022.<br /></Admonition>

If that container is prematurely finalized (which is only possible via Unchecked_Deallocation, as accessibility checks prevent passing a container to Reference that will not live as long as the result), the finalization of the object of Reference_Type will try to access a nonexistent object. This is a normal case of a dangling pointer created by Unchecked_Deallocation; we have to explicitly mention it here as the pointer in question is not visible in the specification of the type. (This is the same reason we have to say this for invalid cursors.) <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0265-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />When a bounded vector object <em>V</em> is finalized, if tampering with cursors is prohibited for <em>V</em> other than due to an assignment from another vector, then execution is erroneous. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>This is a tampering event, but since the implementation is not allowed to use Ada.Finalization, it is not possible in a pure Ada implementation to detect this error. (There is no Finalize routine that will be called that could make the check.) Since the check probably cannot be made, the bad effects that could occur (such as an iterator going into an infinite loop or accessing a nonexistent element) cannot be prevented and we have to allow anything. We do allow re-assigning an object that only prohibits tampering because it was copied from another object as that cannot cause any negative effects. <br /></Admonition>

If an program used a set whose actual Element_Type does not have PI in a context when PI is required (such as a library-level object in a preelaborated unit or as a component of a type with PI), the program would be illegal in Ada 2022 but legal in original Ada 2012.

{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0111-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Tampering with elements is now defined to be equivalent to tampering with cursors for bounded containers. If a program requires tampering detection to work, it might fail in Ada 2022. Needless to say, this shouldn't happen outside of test programs.

{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0409-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong>A bounded tree now only has Preelaborable_Initialization (abbreviated PI in this note) when the actual for the Element_Type has PI. If an program used a tree whose actual Element_Type does not have PI in a context when PI is required (such as a library-level object in a preelaborated unit or as a component of a type with PI), the program would be illegal in Ada 2022 but legal in original Ada 2012. This situation is unlikely, especially as some existing Ada 2012 implementations reject the instance in this case. <br /></Admonition>

If Dequeue is an entry, then the dequeued object would have to be an <strong>out</strong> parameter and that would require the queue client to guess the tag and constraints of the value that will be dequeued (otherwise Constraint_Error would be raised), and that is rarely going to be possible. <br /></Admonition>

#### Implementation Advice

<MarginText>15/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0254-1"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0254-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Bounded holder objects should be implemented without dynamic allocation and any finalization should be trivial unless Element_Type needs finalization. <br /></p>

<MarginText>15.a.1/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-advice" title="Implementation Advice">
<strong></strong>Bounded holder objects should be implemented without dynamic allocation.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>15.a/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>Implementation of this container in Ada will probably require the use of a special storage pool. When we say "without dynamic allocation", we mean that this pool does not use heap memory and has a trivial finalization routine (that is, procedures Adjust and Finalize are null procedures). All storage pools are controlled, so we can't reasonably say that a bounded holder will not need finalization. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>15.b/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>If the implementation supports discontiguous objects that require multiple calls to Allocate in a storage pool, the storage pool will need to support such allocations. The storage pool implementation can assume that all Allocate calls occur together, and similarly for Deallocate calls, thus simplifying the pool implementation so that allocation only occurs at a high-water mark location. <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0350-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0445-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The  about the Move and Swap operations is deleted for bounded holders; these operations can copy elements as necessary.<br /></p>

<MarginText>16.a/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>The memory of a bounded indefinite holder belongs directly to the container, so it cannot be moved with the element. If the element type contains any internal pointers, moving it without calling Adjust would leave such pointers pointing to the wrong holder object. Thus, a full copy is needed, including any associated finalization and adjustments. <br /></Admonition>
