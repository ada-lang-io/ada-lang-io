<p>[This subclause specifies the language-defined model for hardware interrupts in addition to mechanisms for handling interrupts.] <br /></p>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>[An <i>interrupt</i> represents a class of events that are detected by the hardware or the system software.] Interrupts are said to occur. An <i>occurrence</i> of an interrupt is separable into generation and delivery. <i>Generation</i> of an interrupt is the event in the underlying hardware or system that makes the interrupt available to the program. <i>Delivery</i> is the action that invokes part of the program as response to the interrupt occurrence. Between generation and delivery, the interrupt occurrence [(or interrupt)] is <i>pending</i>. Some or all interrupts may be <i>blocked</i>. When an interrupt is blocked, all occurrences of that interrupt are prevented from being delivered. Certain interrupts are <i>reserved</i>. The set of reserved interrupts is implementation defined. A reserved interrupt is either an interrupt for which user-defined handlers are not supported, or one which already has an attached handler by some other implementation-defined means. Program units can be connected to nonreserved interrupts. While connected, the program unit is said to be <i>attached</i> to that interrupt. The execution of that program unit, the <i>interrupt handler</i>, is invoked upon delivery of the interrupt occurrence. <br /></p>

<b>To be honest: </b>As an obsolescent feature, interrupts may be attached to task entries by an address clause. See <a href="/docs/arm/AA-J/AA-J.7#Subclause_J.7.1">J.7.1</a>. <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>While a handler is attached to an interrupt, it is called once for each delivered occurrence of that interrupt. While the handler executes, the corresponding interrupt is blocked.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>While an interrupt is blocked, all occurrences of that interrupt are prevented from being delivered. Whether such occurrences remain pending or are lost is implementation defined.<br /></p>

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<p>Each interrupt has a <i>default treatment</i> which determines the system's response to an occurrence of that interrupt when no user-defined handler is attached. The set of possible default treatments is implementation defined, as is the method (if one exists) for configuring the default treatments for interrupts.<br /></p>

<MarginText>6</MarginText>
<p>An interrupt is delivered to the handler (or default treatment) that is in effect for that interrupt at the time of delivery.<br /></p>

The value of the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> identifies an interrupt. As part of the initialization of that object, <i>P</i> (the <i>handler</i> procedure) is attached to the identified interrupt. A check is made that the corresponding interrupt is not reserved. Program{"_"}Error is raised if the check fails, and the existing treatment for the interrupt is not affected.<br /></p>

Thus, an implementation needs to be able to restore handlers during the execution of the program. (An object with an Interrupt{"_"}Handler aspect also need not be at the library level, but such a handler cannot be attached to an interrupt using the Interrupts package.) <br />

Dropped the requirement that an object of a type containing an Interrupt{"_"}Handler pragma must be declared at the library level. This was a generic contract model violation. This change is not an extension, as an attempt to attach such a handler with a routine in package Interrupts will fail an accessibility check anyway. Moreover, implementations can retain the rule as an implementation-defined restriction on the use of the type, as permitted by the Implementation Permissions above. <br />

#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>13_C.3.2</MarginText>
<p>The Interrupt{"_"}Id type is an implementation-defined discrete type used to identify interrupts.<br /></p>

<MarginText>14_C.3.2</MarginText>
<p>The Is{"_"}Reserved function returns True if and only if the specified interrupt is reserved.<br /></p>

<MarginText>15_C.3.2</MarginText>
<p>The Is{"_"}Attached function returns True if and only if a user-specified interrupt handler is attached to the interrupt.<br /></p>

<MarginText>16/1_C.3.2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00166-01"]} />
<p>{"{"}<i>8652/0069</i>{"}"} The Current{"_"}Handler function returns a value that represents the attached handler of the interrupt. If no user-defined handler is attached to the interrupt, Current{"_"}Handler returns <b>null</b>.<br /></p>

<MarginText>17/3_C.3.2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1"]} />
<p>The Attach{"_"}Handler procedure attaches the specified handler to the interrupt, overriding any existing treatment (including a user handler) in effect for that interrupt. If New{"_"}Handler is <b>null</b>, the default treatment is restored. If New{"_"}Handler designates a protected procedure for which the aspect Interrupt{"_"}Handler is False, Program{"_"}Error is raised. In this case, the operation does not modify the existing interrupt treatment.<br /></p>

<MarginText>18/1_C.3.2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00166-01"]} />
<p>{"{"}<i>8652/0069</i>{"}"} The Exchange{"_"}Handler procedure operates in the same manner as Attach{"_"}Handler with the addition that the value returned in Old{"_"}Handler designates the previous treatment for the specified interrupt. If the previous treatment is not a user-defined handler, <b>null</b> is returned. <br /></p>

<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00166-01"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
{"{"}<i>8652/0069</i>{"}"} If the application uses only parameterless procedures as handlers (other types of handlers may be provided by the implementation, but are not required by the standard), then if Old{"_"}Handler is not <b>null</b>, it may be called to execute the previous handler. This provides a way to cascade application interrupt handlers. However, the default handler cannot be cascaded this way (Old{"_"}Handler must be <b>null</b> for the default handler). <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>19_C.3.2</MarginText>
<p>The Detach{"_"}Handler procedure restores the default treatment for the specified interrupt.<br /></p>

<MarginText>20_C.3.2</MarginText>
<p>For all operations defined in this package that take a parameter of type Interrupt{"_"}Id, with the exception of Is{"_"}Reserved and Reference, a check is made that the specified interrupt is not reserved. Program{"_"}Error is raised if this check fails.<br /></p>

<MarginText>21/3_C.3.2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1"]} />
<p>If, by using the Attach{"_"}Handler, Detach{"_"}Handler, or Exchange{"_"}Handler procedures, an attempt is made to detach a handler that was attached statically (using the aspect Attach{"_"}Handler), the handler is not detached and Program{"_"}Error is raised.<br /></p>

<MarginText>22/2_C.3.2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01"]} />
<p>The Reference function returns a value of type System.Address that can be used to attach a task entry via an address clause (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-J/AA-J.7#Subclause_J.7.1">J.7.1</a>) to the interrupt specified by Interrupt. This function raises Program{"_"}Error if attaching task entries to interrupts (or to this particular interrupt) is not supported.<br /></p>

<MarginText>22.1/3_C.3.2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0153-3"]} />
<p>The function Get{"_"}CPU returns the processor on which the handler for Interrupt is executed. If the handler can execute on more than one processor the value System.Multiprocessors.Not{"_"}A{"_"}Specific{"_"}CPU is returned.<br /></p>


#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>23_C.3.2</MarginText>
<p>At no time during attachment or exchange of handlers shall the current handler of the corresponding interrupt be undefined.<br /></p>


#### Documentation Requirements

<MarginText>24/5_C.3.2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01", "AI05-0229-1", "AI12-0320-1", "AI12-0444-1"]} />
<p>The implementation shall document, when the Ceiling{"_"}Locking policy (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) is in effect, the default ceiling priority assigned to a protected object that contains a protected procedure that specifies either the Attach{"_"}Handler or Interrupt{"_"}Handler aspects, but does not specify the Interrupt{"_"}Priority aspect.

#### Implementation Advice

<MarginText>25_C.3.2</MarginText>
<p>If implementation-defined forms of interrupt handler procedures are supported, such as protected procedures with parameters, then for each such form of a handler, a type analogous to Parameterless{"_"}Handler should be specified in a child package of Interrupts, with the same operations as in the predefined package Interrupts.<br /></p>
