#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>[An <em>interrupt</em> represents a class of events that are detected by the hardware or the system software.] Interrupts are said to occur. An <em>occurrence</em> of an interrupt is separable into generation and delivery. <em>Generation</em> of an interrupt is the event in the underlying hardware or system that makes the interrupt available to the program. <em>Delivery</em> is the action that invokes part of the program as response to the interrupt occurrence. Between generation and delivery, the interrupt occurrence [(or interrupt)] is <em>pending</em>. Some or all interrupts may be <em>blocked</em>. When an interrupt is blocked, all occurrences of that interrupt are prevented from being delivered. Certain interrupts are <em>reserved</em>. The set of reserved interrupts is implementation defined. A reserved interrupt is either an interrupt for which user-defined handlers are not supported, or one which already has an attached handler by some other implementation-defined means. Program units can be connected to nonreserved interrupts. While connected, the program unit is said to be <em>attached</em> to that interrupt. The execution of that program unit, the <em>interrupt handler</em>, is invoked upon delivery of the interrupt occurrence. <br /></p>

<MarginText>2.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>As an obsolescent feature, interrupts may be attached to task entries by an address clause. See <a href="../AA-J/AA-J.7#Subclause_J.7.1">J.7.1</a>. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>While a handler is attached to an interrupt, it is called once for each delivered occurrence of that interrupt. While the handler executes, the corresponding interrupt is blocked.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>While an interrupt is blocked, all occurrences of that interrupt are prevented from being delivered. Whether such occurrences remain pending or are lost is implementation defined.<br /></p>

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<p>Each interrupt has a <em>default treatment</em> which determines the system's response to an occurrence of that interrupt when no user-defined handler is attached. The set of possible default treatments is implementation defined, as is the method (if one exists) for configuring the default treatments for interrupts.<br /></p>

<MarginText>6</MarginText>
<p>An interrupt is delivered to the handler (or default treatment) that is in effect for that interrupt at the time of delivery.<br /></p>

<MarginText>7</MarginText>
<p>An exception propagated from a handler that is invoked by an interrupt has no effect.<br /></p>

<MarginText>8</MarginText>
<p>[If the Ceiling_Locking policy (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) is in effect, the interrupt handler executes with the active priority that is the ceiling priority of the corresponding protected object.]<br /></p>


#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0445-1"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0445-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The implementation shall provide a mechanism to determine the minimum stack space that is necessary  for each interrupt handler and to reserve that space for the execution of the handler. [This space should accommodate nested invocations of the handler where the system permits this.]<br /></p>

<MarginText>10</MarginText>
<p>If the hardware or the underlying system holds pending interrupt occurrences, the implementation shall provide for later delivery of these occurrences to the program.<br /></p>

<MarginText>11</MarginText>
<p>If the Ceiling_Locking policy is not in effect, the implementation shall provide means for the application to specify whether interrupts are to be blocked during protected actions.<br /></p>

In addition to the places where Legality Rules normally apply (see <a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3">12.3</a>), this rule also applies in the private part of an instance of a generic unit.<br /></p>

The protected types can be declared in the private part if this is desired. Note that while the 'Access to use the handler would provide the check in the case of Interrupt_Handler, there is no other check for Attach_Handler. Since these aspects are so similar, we want the rules to be the same. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>8/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00253-01", "AI95-00303-01", "AI05-0033-1"]} /><p><em>This paragraph was deleted.</em>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00253-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00303-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0033-1"}</em>{"}"} <br /></p>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>9/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />If the Interrupt_Handler aspect of a protected procedure is True, then the procedure may be attached dynamically, as a handler, to interrupts (see <a href="../AA-C/AA-C.3#Subclause_C.3.2">C.3.2</a>). [Such procedures are allowed to be attached to multiple interrupts.]<br /></p>

<MarginText>10/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> specified for the Attach_Handler aspect of a protected procedure <em>P</em> is evaluated as part of the creation of the protected object that contains <em>P</em>. The value of the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> identifies an interrupt. As part of the initialization of that object, <em>P</em> (the <em>handler</em> procedure) is attached to the identified interrupt. A check is made that the corresponding interrupt is not reserved. Program_Error is raised if the check fails, and the existing treatment for the interrupt is not affected.<br /></p>

<MarginText>11/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01", "AI05-0229-1"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00434-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />If the Ceiling_Locking policy (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) is in effect, then upon the initialization of a protected object that contains a protected procedure for which either the Attach_Handler aspect is specified or the  Interrupt_Handler aspect is True, a check is made that the initial ceiling priority of the object is in the range of System.Interrupt_Priority. If the check fails, Program_Error is raised.<br /></p>

<MarginText>12/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00121-01", "AI05-0229-1"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>8652/0068</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00121-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />When a protected object is finalized, for any of its procedures that are attached to interrupts, the handler is detached. If the handler was attached by a procedure in the Interrupts package or if no user handler was previously attached to the interrupt, the default treatment is restored. If the Attach_Handler aspect was specified and the most recently attached handler for the same interrupt is the same as the one that was attached at the time the protected object was initialized, the previous handler is restored. <br /></p>

<MarginText>12.a/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00121-01", "AI95-00303-01", "AI05-0229-1"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">

However, objects of a protected type containing procedures with an Attach_Handler aspect specified need not be at the library level. Thus, an implementation needs to be able to restore handlers during the execution of the program. (An object with an Interrupt_Handler aspect also need not be at the library level, but such a handler cannot be attached to an interrupt using the Interrupts package.) <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>13</MarginText>
<p>When a handler is attached to an interrupt, the interrupt is blocked [(subject to the Implementation Permission in <a href="../AA-C/AA-C.3">C.3</a>)] during the execution of every protected action on the protected object containing the handler.<br /></p>

<MarginText>13.1/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0252-1"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0252-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />If restriction No_Dynamic_Attachment is in effect, then a check is made that the interrupt identified by an Attach_Handler aspect does not appear in any previously elaborated Attach_Handler aspect; Program_Error is raised if this check fails.<br /></p>

<MarginText>13.a/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>When No_Dynamic_Attachment is in effect, it is not possible to call any previous handler. Therefore, the only possibility is to replace the original handler, rendering it ineffective. Having an unused handler in a program is likely a bug, so we require an exception to be raised. <br /></Admonition>


#### Erroneous Execution

<MarginText>14</MarginText>
<p>If the Ceiling_Locking policy (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) is in effect and an interrupt is delivered to a handler, and the interrupt hardware priority is higher than the ceiling priority of the corresponding protected object, the execution of the program is erroneous.<br /></p>

<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00121-01", "AI05-0229-1"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>8652/0068</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00121-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />If the handlers for a given interrupt attached via aspect Attach_Handler are not attached and detached in a stack-like (LIFO) order, program execution is erroneous. In particular, when a protected object is finalized, the execution is erroneous if any of the procedures of the protected object are attached to interrupts via aspect Attach_Handler and the most recently attached handler for the same interrupt is not the same as the one that was attached at the time the protected object was initialized. <br /></p>

<MarginText>14.a/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00121-01", "AI05-0229-1"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>8652/0068</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00121-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />This simplifies implementation of the Attach_Handler aspect by not requiring a check that the current handler is the same as the one attached by the initialization of a protected object. <br /></Admonition>


#### Metrics

<MarginText>15</MarginText>
<p>The following metric shall be documented by the implementation: <br /></p>

<MarginText>16/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01"]} /><ul>
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00434-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The worst-case overhead for an interrupt handler that is a parameterless protected procedure, in clock cycles. This is the execution time not directly attributable to the handler procedure or the interrupted execution. It is estimated as C &ndash; (A+B), where A is how long it takes to complete a given sequence of instructions without any interrupt, B is how long it takes to complete a normal call to a given protected procedure, and C is how long it takes to complete the same sequence of instructions when it is interrupted by one execution of the same procedure called via an interrupt. <br /></li>
</ul>
<MarginText>16.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>The instruction sequence and interrupt handler used to measure interrupt handling overhead should be chosen so as to maximize the execution time cost due to cache misses.

{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00253-01"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br />Amendment </strong> Corrected the wording so that the rules for the use of Attach_Handler and Interrupt_Handler are identical. This means that uses of pragma Interrupt_Handler outside of the target protected type or single protected object are now illegal. <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<MarginText>25.b/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00121-01"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>8652/0068</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00121-01"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br />Corrigendum:</strong> Clarified the meaning of &ldquo;the previous handler&rdquo; when finalizing protected objects containing interrupt handlers.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>25.c/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00303-01"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00303-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Dropped the requirement that an object of a type containing an Interrupt_Handler pragma must be declared at the library level. This was a generic contract model violation. This change is not an extension, as an attempt to attach such a handler with a routine in package Interrupts will fail an accessibility check anyway. Moreover, implementations can retain the rule as an implementation-defined restriction on the use of the type, as permitted by the Implementation Permissions above. <br /></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 2005

<MarginText>25.d/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Aspects Interrupt_Handler and Attach_Handler are new; <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code>s Interrupt_Handler and Attach_Handler are now obsolescent. <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2005

<MarginText>25.e/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0033-1"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0033-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Added missing generic contract wording for the aspects Attach_Handler and Interrupt_Handler. <br /></Admonition>


#### Inconsistencies With Ada 2012

<MarginText>25.f/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0252-1"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0252-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Program_Error might be raised if two handlers are attached when restriction No_Dynamic_Attachment is in effect (including as part of the Ravenscar profile). Original Ada 2012 would have just ignored the first handler. This is almost certainly a bug rather than an intended result. <br /></Admonition>

#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>13</MarginText>
<p>The Interrupt_Id type is an implementation-defined discrete type used to identify interrupts.<br /></p>

<MarginText>14</MarginText>
<p>The Is_Reserved function returns True if and only if the specified interrupt is reserved.<br /></p>

<MarginText>15</MarginText>
<p>The Is_Attached function returns True if and only if a user-specified interrupt handler is attached to the interrupt.<br /></p>

<MarginText>16/1</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00166-01"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>8652/0069</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00166-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The Current_Handler function returns a value that represents the attached handler of the interrupt. If no user-defined handler is attached to the interrupt, Current_Handler returns <strong>null</strong>.<br /></p>

<MarginText>17/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The Attach_Handler procedure attaches the specified handler to the interrupt, overriding any existing treatment (including a user handler) in effect for that interrupt. If New_Handler is <strong>null</strong>, the default treatment is restored. If New_Handler designates a protected procedure for which the aspect Interrupt_Handler is False, Program_Error is raised. In this case, the operation does not modify the existing interrupt treatment.<br /></p>

<MarginText>18/1</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00166-01"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>8652/0069</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00166-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The Exchange_Handler procedure operates in the same manner as Attach_Handler with the addition that the value returned in Old_Handler designates the previous treatment for the specified interrupt. If the previous treatment is not a user-defined handler, <strong>null</strong> is returned. <br /></p>

<MarginText>18.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>Calling Attach_Handler or Exchange_Handler with this value for New_Handler restores the previous handler.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>18.a.1/1</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00166-01"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>8652/0069</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00166-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />If the application uses only parameterless procedures as handlers (other types of handlers may be provided by the implementation, but are not required by the standard), then if Old_Handler is not <strong>null</strong>, it may be called to execute the previous handler. This provides a way to cascade application interrupt handlers. However, the default handler cannot be cascaded this way (Old_Handler must be <strong>null</strong> for the default handler). <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>19</MarginText>
<p>The Detach_Handler procedure restores the default treatment for the specified interrupt.<br /></p>

<MarginText>20</MarginText>
<p>For all operations defined in this package that take a parameter of type Interrupt_Id, with the exception of Is_Reserved and Reference, a check is made that the specified interrupt is not reserved. Program_Error is raised if this check fails.<br /></p>

<MarginText>21/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />If, by using the Attach_Handler, Detach_Handler, or Exchange_Handler procedures, an attempt is made to detach a handler that was attached statically (using the aspect Attach_Handler), the handler is not detached and Program_Error is raised.<br /></p>

<MarginText>22/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00434-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The Reference function returns a value of type System.Address that can be used to attach a task entry via an address clause (see <a href="../AA-J/AA-J.7#Subclause_J.7.1">J.7.1</a>) to the interrupt specified by Interrupt. This function raises Program_Error if attaching task entries to interrupts (or to this particular interrupt) is not supported.<br /></p>

<MarginText>22.1/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0153-3"]} /><p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0153-3"}</em>{"}"} <br />The function Get_CPU returns the processor on which the handler for Interrupt is executed. If the handler can execute on more than one processor the value System.Multiprocessors.Not_A_Specific_CPU is returned.<br /></p>


#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>23</MarginText>
<p>At no time during attachment or exchange of handlers shall the current handler of the corresponding interrupt be undefined.<br /></p>

[This default can be different  for different  interrupts.] <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>Documentation Requirement: </strong>If the Ceiling_Locking policy is in effect, the default ceiling priority for a protected object that specifies an interrupt handler aspect.<br /></Admonition>


#### Implementation Advice

<MarginText>25</MarginText>
<p>If implementation-defined forms of interrupt handler procedures are supported, such as protected procedures with parameters, then for each such form of a handler, a type analogous to Parameterless_Handler should be specified in a child package of Interrupts, with the same operations as in the predefined package Interrupts.<br /></p>
