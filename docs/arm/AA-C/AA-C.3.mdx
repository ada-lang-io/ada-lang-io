<p>[This subclause specifies the language-defined model for hardware interrupts in addition to mechanisms for handling interrupts.] <br /></p>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>[An <em>interrupt</em> represents a class of events that are detected by the hardware or the system software.] Interrupts are said to occur. An <em>occurrence</em> of an interrupt is separable into generation and delivery. <em>Generation</em> of an interrupt is the event in the underlying hardware or system that makes the interrupt available to the program. <em>Delivery</em> is the action that invokes part of the program as response to the interrupt occurrence. Between generation and delivery, the interrupt occurrence [(or interrupt)] is <em>pending</em>. Some or all interrupts may be <em>blocked</em>. When an interrupt is blocked, all occurrences of that interrupt are prevented from being delivered. Certain interrupts are <em>reserved</em>. The set of reserved interrupts is implementation defined. A reserved interrupt is either an interrupt for which user-defined handlers are not supported, or one which already has an attached handler by some other implementation-defined means. Program units can be connected to nonreserved interrupts. While connected, the program unit is said to be <em>attached</em> to that interrupt. The execution of that program unit, the <em>interrupt handler</em>, is invoked upon delivery of the interrupt occurrence. <br /></p>

<MarginText>2.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>As an obsolescent feature, interrupts may be attached to task entries by an address clause. See <a href="../AA-J/AA-J.7#Subclause_J.7.1">J.7.1</a>. <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>While a handler is attached to an interrupt, it is called once for each delivered occurrence of that interrupt. While the handler executes, the corresponding interrupt is blocked.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>While an interrupt is blocked, all occurrences of that interrupt are prevented from being delivered. Whether such occurrences remain pending or are lost is implementation defined.<br /></p>

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<p>Each interrupt has a <em>default treatment</em> which determines the system's response to an occurrence of that interrupt when no user-defined handler is attached. The set of possible default treatments is implementation defined, as is the method (if one exists) for configuring the default treatments for interrupts.<br /></p>

<MarginText>6</MarginText>
<p>An interrupt is delivered to the handler (or default treatment) that is in effect for that interrupt at the time of delivery.<br /></p>

<MarginText>7</MarginText>
<p>An exception propagated from a handler that is invoked by an interrupt has no effect.<br /></p>

<MarginText>8</MarginText>
<p>[If the Ceiling_Locking policy (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) is in effect, the interrupt handler executes with the active priority that is the ceiling priority of the corresponding protected object.]<br /></p>


#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>9/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0445-1"]} />
<p>The implementation shall provide a mechanism to determine the minimum stack space that is necessary  for each interrupt handler and to reserve that space for the execution of the handler. [This space should accommodate nested invocations of the handler where the system permits this.]<br /></p>

<MarginText>10</MarginText>
<p>If the hardware or the underlying system holds pending interrupt occurrences, the implementation shall provide for later delivery of these occurrences to the program.<br /></p>

<MarginText>11</MarginText>
<p>If the Ceiling_Locking policy is not in effect, the implementation shall provide means for the application to specify whether interrupts are to be blocked during protected actions.<br /></p>


#### Documentation Requirements

#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>9/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1"]} />
<p>If the Interrupt_Handler aspect of a protected procedure is True, then the procedure may be attached dynamically, as a handler, to interrupts (see <a href="../AA-C/AA-C.3#Subclause_C.3.2">C.3.2</a>). [Such procedures are allowed to be attached to multiple interrupts.]<br /></p>

<p>The <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> specified for the Attach_Handler aspect of a protected procedure <em>P</em> is evaluated as part of the creation of the protected object that contains <em>P</em>. The value of the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> identifies an interrupt. As part of the initialization of that object, <em>P</em> (the <em>handler</em> procedure) is attached to the identified interrupt. A check is made that the corresponding interrupt is not reserved. Program_Error is raised if the check fails, and the existing treatment for the interrupt is not affected.<br /></p>

<MarginText>11/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01", "AI05-0229-1"]} />
<p>If the Ceiling_Locking policy (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) is in effect, then upon the initialization of a protected object that contains a protected procedure for which either the Attach_Handler aspect is specified or the  Interrupt_Handler aspect is True, a check is made that the initial ceiling priority of the object is in the range of System.Interrupt_Priority.

<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>8652/0068</em>{"}"} If all protected objects for interrupt handlers are declared at the library level, the finalization discussed above occurs only as part of the finalization of all library-level packages in a partition. However, objects of a protected type containing procedures with an Attach_Handler aspect specified need not be at the library level. Thus, an implementation needs to be able to restore handlers during the execution of the program. (An object with an Interrupt_Handler aspect also need not be at the library level, but such a handler cannot be attached to an interrupt using the Interrupts package.) <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>13</MarginText>
<p>When a handler is attached to an interrupt, the interrupt is blocked [(subject to the Implementation Permission in <a href="../AA-C/AA-C.3">C.3</a>)] during the execution of every protected action on the protected object containing the handler.<br /></p>

</AnnotatedOnly>


#### Erroneous Execution

<MarginText>14</MarginText>
<p>If the Ceiling_Locking policy (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) is in effect and an interrupt is delivered to a handler, and the interrupt hardware priority is higher than the ceiling priority of the corresponding protected object, the execution of the program is erroneous.<br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0068</em>{"}"} If the handlers for a given interrupt attached via aspect Attach_Handler are not attached and detached in a stack-like (LIFO) order, program execution is erroneous. In particular, when a protected object is finalized, the execution is erroneous if any of the procedures of the protected object are attached to interrupts via aspect Attach_Handler and the most recently attached handler for the same interrupt is not the same as the one that was attached at the time the protected object was initialized. <br /></p>

#### Metrics

<MarginText>15</MarginText>
<p>The following metric shall be documented by the implementation: <br /></p>

<MarginText>16/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01"]} />
<ul>
<li>The worst-case overhead for an interrupt handler that is a parameterless protected procedure, in clock cycles. This is the execution time not directly attributable to the handler procedure or the interrupted execution. It is estimated as C &ndash; (A+B), where A is how long it takes to complete a given sequence of instructions without any interrupt, B is how long it takes to complete a normal call to a given protected procedure, and C is how long it takes to complete the same sequence of instructions when it is interrupted by one execution of the same procedure called via an interrupt. <br /></li>
</ul>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>16.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note">
<strong></strong>The instruction sequence and interrupt handler used to measure interrupt handling overhead should be chosen so as to maximize the execution time cost due to cache misses.

#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>13</MarginText>
<p>The Interrupt_Id type is an implementation-defined discrete type used to identify interrupts.<br /></p>

<MarginText>14</MarginText>
<p>The Is_Reserved function returns True if and only if the specified interrupt is reserved.<br /></p>

<MarginText>15</MarginText>
<p>The Is_Attached function returns True if and only if a user-specified interrupt handler is attached to the interrupt.<br /></p>

<MarginText>16/1</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00166-01"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0069</em>{"}"} The Current_Handler function returns a value that represents the attached handler of the interrupt. If no user-defined handler is attached to the interrupt, Current_Handler returns <strong>null</strong>.<br /></p>

<MarginText>17/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1"]} />
<p>The Attach_Handler procedure attaches the specified handler to the interrupt, overriding any existing treatment (including a user handler) in effect for that interrupt. If New_Handler is <strong>null</strong>, the default treatment is restored. If New_Handler designates a protected procedure for which the aspect Interrupt_Handler is False, Program_Error is raised. In this case, the operation does not modify the existing interrupt treatment.<br /></p>

<MarginText>18/1</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00166-01"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0069</em>{"}"} The Exchange_Handler procedure operates in the same manner as Attach_Handler with the addition that the value returned in Old_Handler designates the previous treatment for the specified interrupt. If the previous treatment is not a user-defined handler, <strong>null</strong> is returned. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>18.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<strong></strong>Calling Attach_Handler or Exchange_Handler with this value for New_Handler restores the previous handler.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>18.a.1/1</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00166-01"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
{"{"}<em>8652/0069</em>{"}"} If the application uses only parameterless procedures as handlers (other types of handlers may be provided by the implementation, but are not required by the standard), then if Old_Handler is not <strong>null</strong>, it may be called to execute the previous handler. This provides a way to cascade application interrupt handlers. However, the default handler cannot be cascaded this way (Old_Handler must be <strong>null</strong> for the default handler). <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>19</MarginText>
<p>The Detach_Handler procedure restores the default treatment for the specified interrupt.<br /></p>

<MarginText>20</MarginText>
<p>For all operations defined in this package that take a parameter of type Interrupt_Id, with the exception of Is_Reserved and Reference, a check is made that the specified interrupt is not reserved. Program_Error is raised if this check fails.<br /></p>

<MarginText>21/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1"]} />
<p>If, by using the Attach_Handler, Detach_Handler, or Exchange_Handler procedures, an attempt is made to detach a handler that was attached statically (using the aspect Attach_Handler), the handler is not detached and Program_Error is raised.<br /></p>

<MarginText>22/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01"]} />
<p>The Reference function returns a value of type System.Address that can be used to attach a task entry via an address clause (see <a href="../AA-J/AA-J.7#Subclause_J.7.1">J.7.1</a>) to the interrupt specified by Interrupt. This function raises Program_Error if attaching task entries to interrupts (or to this particular interrupt) is not supported.<br /></p>

<MarginText>22.1/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0153-3"]} />
<p>The function Get_CPU returns the processor on which the handler for Interrupt is executed. If the handler can execute on more than one processor the value System.Multiprocessors.Not_A_Specific_CPU is returned.<br /></p>


#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>23</MarginText>
<p>At no time during attachment or exchange of handlers shall the current handler of the corresponding interrupt be undefined.<br /></p>


#### Documentation Requirements

<MarginText>24/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01", "AI05-0229-1", "AI12-0320-1", "AI12-0444-1"]} />
<p>The implementation shall document, when  the Ceiling_Locking policy (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) is in effect,  the default ceiling priority assigned to a protected object that contains a protected procedure that specifies either the Attach_Handler or Interrupt_Handler aspects, but does not specify the Interrupt_Priority aspect. [This default can be different  for different  interrupts.] <br /></p>

<MarginText>24.a.1/3</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
<strong>Documentation Requirement: </strong>If the Ceiling_Locking policy is in effect, the default ceiling priority for a protected object that specifies an interrupt handler aspect.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>


#### Implementation Advice

<MarginText>25</MarginText>
<p>If implementation-defined forms of interrupt handler procedures are supported, such as protected procedures with parameters, then for each such form of a handler, a type analogous to Parameterless_Handler should be specified in a child package of Interrupts, with the same operations as in the predefined package Interrupts.<br /></p>
