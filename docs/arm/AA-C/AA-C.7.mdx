<MarginText>7</MarginText>
end Ada.Task_Attributes;{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>

#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>8</MarginText>
<p>When an instance of Task_Attributes is elaborated in a given active partition, an object of the actual type corresponding to the formal type Attribute is implicitly created for each task (of that partition) that exists and is not yet terminated. This object acts as a user-defined attribute of the task. A task created previously in the partition and not yet terminated has this attribute from that point on. Each task subsequently created in the partition will have this attribute when created. In all these cases, the initial value of the given attribute is Initial_Value.<br /></p>

<MarginText>9</MarginText>
<p>The Value operation returns the value of the corresponding attribute of T.<br /></p>

<MarginText>10</MarginText>
<p>The Reference operation returns an access value that designates the corresponding attribute of T.<br /></p>

<MarginText>11</MarginText>
<p>The Set_Value operation performs any finalization on the old value of the attribute of T and assigns Val to that attribute (see <a href="../AA-5/AA-5.2">5.2</a> and <a href="../AA-7/AA-7.6">7.6</a>).<br /></p>

<MarginText>12</MarginText>
<p>The effect of the Reinitialize operation is the same as Set_Value where the Val parameter is replaced with Initial_Value. <br /></p>

<MarginText>12.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note">
<strong></strong>In most cases, the attribute memory can be reclaimed at this point. <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>13</MarginText>
<p>For all the operations declared in this package, Tasking_Error is raised if the task identified by T is terminated. Program_Error is raised if the value of T is Null_Task_Id.<br /></p>

<MarginText>13.1/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00237-01"]} />

<MarginText>13.a/2</MarginText>

<strong></strong>This is necessary so that a task attribute does not outlive its type. For instance, that's possible if the instantiation is nested, and the attribute is on a library-level task. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00165-01"]} />
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0071</em>{"}"} If the package Ada.Task_Attributes is instantiated with a controlled type and the controlled type has user-defined Adjust or Finalize operations that in turn access task attributes by any of the above operations, then a call of Set_Value of the instantiated package constitutes a bounded error. The call may perform as expected or may result in forever blocking the calling task and subsequently some or all tasks of the partition. <br /></p>


#### Erroneous Execution

<p>The implementation shall document the following metrics: A task calling the following subprograms shall execute at a sufficiently high priority as to not be preempted during the measurement period. This period shall start just before issuing the call and end just after the call completes. If the attributes of task T are accessed by the measurement tests, no other task shall access attributes of that task during the measurement period. For all measurements described here, the Attribute type shall be a scalar type whose size is equal to the size of the predefined type Integer. For each measurement, two cases shall be documented: one where the accessed attributes are of the calling task [(that is, the default value for the T parameter is used)], and the other, where T identifies another, nonterminated, task.<br /></p>

#### Implementation Permissions

<MarginText>28/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0444-1"]} />
<p>An implementation can avoid  actually creating  the object corresponding to a task attribute until its value is set to something other than that of Initial_Value, or until Reference is called for the task attribute. Similarly, when the value of the attribute is to be reinitialized to that of Initial_Value, the object may instead be finalized and its storage reclaimed, to be recreated when needed later. While the object does not exist, the function Value may simply return Initial_Value, rather than implicitly creating the object. <br /></p>

#### Implementation Advice

<MarginText>30/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01", "AI12-0438-1"]} />
<p>Some implementations are targeted to domains in which memory use at run time has to  be completely deterministic. For such implementations, it is recommended that the storage for task attributes will be pre-allocated statically and not from the heap. This can be accomplished by either placing restrictions on the number and the size of the attributes of a task, or by using the pre-allocated storage for the first N attribute objects, and the heap for the others. In the latter case, N should be documented.<br /></p>

<strong></strong>This is necessary because the normative wording only says that attributes are finalized &ldquo;after&rdquo; task termination. Without this advice, waiting until the instance is finalized would meet the requirements (it is after termination, but may be a very long time after termination). We can't say anything more specific than this, as we do not want to require the overhead of an interaction with the tasking system to be done at a specific point. <br /></Admonition>

#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>8/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00266-02", "AI05-0202-1"]} />
<p>The type Termination_Handler identifies a protected procedure to be executed by the implementation when a task terminates. Such a protected procedure is called a <em>handler</em>. In all cases T identifies the task that is terminating. If the task terminates due to completing the last statement of its body, or as a result of waiting on a terminate alternative, and the finalization of the task completes normally, then Cause is set to Normal and X is set to Null_Occurrence. If the task terminates because it is being aborted, then Cause is set to Abnormal; X is set to Null_Occurrence if the finalization of the task completes normally. If the task terminates because of an exception raised by the execution of its <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.1#S0248">task_body</a></code>, then Cause is set to Unhandled_Exception; X is set to the associated exception occurrence if the finalization of the task completes normally. Independent of how the task completes, if finalization of the task propagates an exception, then Cause is either Unhandled_Exception or Abnormal, and X is an exception occurrence that identifies the Program_Error exception.<br /></p>

<MarginText>9/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00266-02"]} />
<p>Each task has two termination handlers, a <em>fall-back handler</em> and a <em>specific handler</em>. The specific handler applies only to the task itself, while the fall-back handler applies only to the dependent tasks of the task. A handler is said to be <em>set</em> if it is associated with a nonnull value of type Termination_Handler, and <em>cleared</em> otherwise. When a task is created, its specific handler and fall-back handler are cleared.<br /></p>

<MarginText>10/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00266-02", "AI05-0264-1"]} />
<p>The procedure Set_Dependents_Fallback_Handler changes the fall-back handler for the calling task: if Handler is <strong>null</strong>, that fall-back handler is cleared; otherwise, it is set to be Handler.<strong>all</strong>. If a fall-back handler had previously been set it is replaced.<br /></p>

<MarginText>11/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00266-02", "AI05-0264-1"]} />
<p>The function Current_Task_Fallback_Handler returns the fall-back handler that is currently set for the calling task, if one is set; otherwise, it returns <strong>null</strong>.<br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<strong></strong>This package cannot portably be used to set a handler on the program as a whole. It is possible to call Set_Specific_Handler with the environment task's ID. But any call to the handler would necessarily be a Bounded (Run-Time) Error, as the handler is called after the task's finalization has completed. In the case of the environment task, that includes any possible protected objects, and calling a protected object after it is finalized is a Bounded (Run-Time) Error (see <a href="../AA-9/AA-9.4">9.4</a>). This might work in a particular implementation, but it cannot be depended upon. <br /></Admonition>

<p>As part of the finalization of a <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.1#S0248">task_body</a></code>, after performing the actions specified in <a href="../AA-7/AA-7.6">7.6</a> for finalization of a master, the specific handler for the task, if one is set, is executed. If the specific handler is cleared, a search for a fall-back handler proceeds by recursively following the master relationship for the task. If a task is found whose fall-back handler is set, that handler is executed; otherwise, no handler is executed.<br /></p>

<MarginText>15/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00266-02"]} />
<p>For Set_Specific_Handler or Specific_Handler, Tasking_Error is raised if the task identified by T has already terminated. Program_Error is raised if the value of T is Ada.Task_Identification.Null_Task_Id.<br /></p>

<strong></strong> Specified what is passed to the handler if the finalization of the task fails after it is completed. This was not specified at all in Ada 2005, so there is a possibility that some program depended on some other behavior of an implementation. But as this case is very unlikely (and only occurs when there is already a significant bug in the program - so should not occur in fielded systems), we're not listing this as an inconsistency. <br /></Admonition>
