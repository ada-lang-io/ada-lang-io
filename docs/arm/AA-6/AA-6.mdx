<p>A subprogram is a program unit or intrinsic operation whose execution is invoked by a subprogram call. There are two forms of subprogram: procedures and functions. A procedure call is a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-5/AA-5.1#S0167">statement</a></code>; a function call is an expression and returns a value. The definition of a subprogram can be given in two parts: a subprogram declaration defining its interface, and a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-6/AA-6.3#S0216">subprogram_body</a></code> defining its execution. [Operators and enumeration literals are functions.] <br /></p>

<p>A <i>callable entity</i> is a subprogram or entry (see Section 9). A callable entity is invoked by a <i>call</i>; that is, a subprogram call or entry call. A <i>callable construct</i> is a construct that defines the action of a call upon a callable entity: a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-6/AA-6.3#S0216">subprogram_body</a></code>, <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.5#S0260">entry_body</a></code>, or <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.5#S0258">accept_statement</a></code>. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<b></b>Note that &ldquo;callable entity&rdquo; includes predefined operators, enumeration literals, and abstract subprograms. &ldquo;Call&rdquo; includes calls of these things. They do not have callable constructs, since they don't have completions. <br />
