<p>[ The <em>visibility rules</em>, given below, determine which declarations are visible and directly visible at each place within a program. The visibility rules apply to both explicit and implicit declarations.] <br /></p>


#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>A declaration is defined to be <em>directly visible</em> at places where a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> consisting of only an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-2/AA-2.3#S0002">identifier</a></code> or <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-6/AA-6.1#S0202">operator_symbol</a></code> is sufficient to denote the declaration; that is, no <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0098">selected_component</a></code> notation or special context (such as preceding ={">"} in a named association) is necessary to denote the declaration. A declaration is defined to be <em>visible</em> wherever it is directly visible, as well as at other places where some <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> (such as a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0098">selected_component</a></code>) can denote the declaration.<br /></p>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>The syntactic category <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0092">direct_name</a></code> is used to indicate contexts where direct visibility is required. The syntactic category <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0099">selector_name</a></code> is used to indicate contexts where visibility, but not direct visibility, is required.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>There are two kinds of direct visibility: <em>immediate visibility</em> and <em>use-visibility</em>. A declaration is immediately visible at a place if it is directly visible because the place is within its immediate scope. A declaration is use-visible if it is directly visible because of a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-8/AA-8.4#S0235">use_clause</a></code> (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-8/AA-8.4">8.4</a>). Both conditions can apply.<br /></p>

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<p>A declaration can be <em>hidden</em>, either from direct visibility, or from all visibility, within certain parts of its scope. Where <em>hidden from all visibility</em>, it is not visible at all (neither using a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0092">direct_name</a></code> nor a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0099">selector_name</a></code>). Where <em>hidden from direct visibility</em>, only direct visibility is lost; visibility using a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0099">selector_name</a></code> is still possible.<br /></p>

<MarginText>6</MarginText>
<p>[ Two or more declarations are <em>overloaded</em> if they all have the same defining name and there is a place where they are all directly visible.] <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<strong></strong>Note that a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> can have more than one possible interpretation even if it denotes a nonoverloadable entity. For example, if there are two functions F that return records, both containing a component called C, then the name F.C has two possible interpretations, even though component declarations are not overloadable. <br />

This follows from the rules about when a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> denotes a current instance. See AI83-00286. This implies that within a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-12/AA-12.1#S0313">generic_formal_part</a></code>, outer declarations with the same defining name are hidden from direct visibility. It also implies that if a generic formal parameter has the same defining name as the generic itself, the formal parameter hides the generic from direct visibility. <br />

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0025</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>8652/0026</em>{"}"} A nonoverridable declaration is illegal if there is a homograph occurring immediately within the same declarative region that is visible at the place of the declaration, and is not hidden from all visibility by the nonoverridable declaration. In addition, a type extension is illegal if somewhere within its immediate scope it has two visible components with the same name. Similarly, the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-10/AA-10.1#S0292">context_clause</a></code> for a compilation unit is illegal if it mentions (in a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-10/AA-10.1#S0294">with_clause</a></code>) some library unit, and there is a homograph of the library unit that is visible at the place of the compilation unit, and the homograph and the mentioned library unit are both declared immediately within the same declarative region. These rules also apply to dispatching operations declared in the visible part of an instance of a generic unit. However, they do not apply to other overloadable declarations in an instance[; such declarations may have type conformant profiles in the instance, so long as the corresponding declarations in the generic were not type conformant]. <br /></p>

<li>{"{"}<em>8652/0102</em>{"}"} D.NT3 can have a component I because the component I of the parent type is never visible. The parent component exists, of course, but is never declared for the type D.NT3. In the child package A.E, the component I of A.T is visible, but that does not change the fact that the A.T.I component was never declared for type D.NT3. Thus, A.E.NT4 does not (visibly) inherit the component I from A.T, while it does inherit the component I from D.NT3. Of course, both components exist, and can be accessed by a type conversion as shown above. This behavior stems from the fact that every characteristic of a type (including components) must be declared somewhere in the innermost declarative region containing the type &mdash; if the characteristic is never visible in that declarative region, it is never declared. Therefore, such characteristics do not suddenly become available even if they are in fact visible in some other scope.

<strong></strong>The <strong>overriding</strong> and <strong>not overriding</strong> rules differ slightly. For <strong>overriding</strong>, we want the indicator to reflect the overriding state at the place of the declaration; otherwise the indicator would be &ldquo;lying&rdquo;. Whether a homograph is implicitly declared after the declaration (see 7.3.1 to see how this can happen) has no impact on this check. However, <strong>not overriding</strong> is different; &ldquo;lying&rdquo; would happen if a homograph declared later actually is overriding. So, we require this check to take into account later overridings. That can be implemented either by looking ahead, or by rechecking when additional operations are declared.<br />

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<strong></strong>In this case, the subprograms are abstract, so misspellings will get detected anyway. But for other subprograms (especially when deriving from concrete types), the error might never be detected, and a body other than the one the programmer intended might be executed without warning. Thus our new motto: &ldquo;Overriding indicators &mdash; don't derive a type without them!&rdquo; <br />
