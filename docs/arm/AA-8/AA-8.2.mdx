<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>[For each declaration, the language rules define a certain portion of the program text called the <em>scope</em> of the declaration. The scope of a declaration is also called the scope of any view or entity declared by the declaration. Within the scope of an entity, and only there, there are places where it is legal to refer to the declared entity. These places are defined by the rules of visibility and overloading.] <br /></p>


#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>The <em>immediate scope</em> of a declaration is a portion of the declarative region immediately enclosing the declaration. The immediate scope starts at the beginning of the declaration, except in the case of an overloadable declaration, in which case the immediate scope starts just after the place where the profile of the callable entity is determined (which is at the end of the <code>_specification</code> for the callable entity, or at the end of the <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0315">generic_instantiation</a></code> if an instance). The immediate scope extends to the end of the declarative region, with the following exceptions: <br /></p>

<MarginText>2.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<strong></strong>The reason for making overloadable declarations with profiles special is to simplify compilation: until the compiler has determined the profile, it doesn't know which other declarations are homographs of this one, so it doesn't know which ones this one should hide. Without this rule, two passes over the <code>_specification</code> or <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0315">generic_instantiation</a></code> would be required to resolve names that denote things with the same name as this one. <br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>Clause 10 defines only a partial ordering of <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0287">library_item</a></code>s. Therefore, it is a good idea to restrict the immediate scope (and the scope, defined below) to semantic dependents.<br /></Admonition>

#### Extensions to Ada 83

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>13.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The fact that the immediate scope of an overloadable declaration does not include its profile is new to Ada 95. It replaces RM83-8.3(16), which said that within a subprogram specification and within the formal part of an entry declaration or accept statement, all declarations with the same designator as the subprogram or entry were hidden from all visibility. The RM83-8.3(16) rule seemed to be overkill, and created both implementation difficulties and unnecessary semantic complexity. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The notion of "visible part" has been extended in Ada 95. The syntax of task and protected units now allows private parts, thus requiring us to be able to talk about the visible part as well. It was necessary to extend the concept to subprograms and to generic units, in order for the visibility rules related to child library units to work properly. It was necessary to define the concept separately for generic formal packages, since their visible part is slightly different from that of a normal package. Extending the concept to composite types made the definition of scope slightly simpler. We define visible part for some things elsewhere, since it makes a big difference to the user for those things. For composite types and subprograms, however, the concept is used only in arcane visibility rules, so we localize it to this subclause.<br /></Admonition>
