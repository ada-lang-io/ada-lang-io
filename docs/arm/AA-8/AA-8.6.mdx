<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0299-1"]} />
<p>[ Because declarations can be overloaded, it is possible for an occurrence of a usage name to have more than one possible interpretation; in most cases, ambiguity is disallowed. This subclause describes how the possible interpretations resolve to the actual interpretation.<br /></p>

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>Certain rules of the language (the Name Resolution Rules) are considered &ldquo;overloading rules&rdquo;. If a possible interpretation violates an overloading rule, it is assumed not to be the intended interpretation; some other possible interpretation is assumed to be the actual interpretation. On the other hand, violations of nonoverloading rules do not affect which interpretation is chosen; instead, they cause the construct to be illegal. To be legal, there usually has to be exactly one acceptable interpretation of a construct that is a &ldquo;complete context&rdquo;, not counting any nested complete contexts.<br /></p>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>The syntax rules of the language and the visibility rules given in <a href="/docs/arm/AA-8/AA-8.3">8.3</a> determine the possible interpretations. Most type checking rules (rules that require a particular type, or a particular class of types, for example) are overloading rules. Various rules for the matching of formal and actual parameters are overloading rules.] <br /></p>

<p>When a construct is one that requires that its expected type be a <i>single</i> type in a given class, the type of the construct shall be determinable solely from the context in which the construct appears, excluding the construct itself, but using the requirement that it be in the given class. Furthermore, the context shall not be one that expects any type in some class that contains types of the given class; in particular, the construct shall not be the operand of a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code>.<br /></p>

<b></b>For example, the expected type for a character literal is required to be a single character type. But the expected type for the operand of a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> is any type. Therefore, a character literal is not allowed as the operand of a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code>. This is true even if there is only one character type in scope (which is never the case).

RM83-8.7(2) might seem to imply that an interpretation embodies information about what is denoted by each usage name, but not information about which syntactic category each construct belongs to.

For example, X(Y) might be a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-6/AA-6.4#S0218">function_call</a></code> or an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0096">indexed_component</a></code>, and no context-free/syntactic information can tell the difference.
