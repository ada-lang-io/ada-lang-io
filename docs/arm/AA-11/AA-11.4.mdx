# 11.4 Exception Handling

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.

<p>[When an exception occurrence is raised, normal program execution is abandoned and control is transferred to an applicable <code><a href="../AA-11/AA-11.2#S0305">exception_handler</a></code>, if any. To <em>handle</em> an exception occurrence is to respond to the exceptional event. To <em>propagate</em> an exception occurrence is to raise it again in another context; that is, to fail to respond to the exceptional event in the present context.] </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>In other words, if the execution of a given construct raises an exception, but does not handle it, the exception is propagated to an enclosing execution (except in the case of a <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.1#S0248">task_body</a></code>).</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Propagation involves re-raising the same exception occurrence. For example, calling an entry of an uncallable task raises Tasking_Error; this is not propagation. </p></Admonition>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<p>Within a given task, if the execution of construct <em>a</em> is defined by this document to consist (in part) of the execution of construct <em>b</em>, then while <em>b</em> is executing, the execution of <em>a</em> is said to <em>dynamically enclose</em> the execution of <em>b</em>. The <em>innermost dynamically enclosing</em> execution of a given execution is the dynamically enclosing execution that started most recently. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>If the execution of <em>a</em> dynamically encloses that of <em>b</em>, then we also say that the execution of <em>b</em> is <em>included in</em> the execution of <em>a</em>. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>Examples: The execution of an <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.3#S0175">if_statement</a></code> dynamically encloses the evaluation of the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5#S0150">condition</a></code> after the <strong>if</strong> (during that evaluation). (Recall that "execution" includes both "elaboration" and "evaluation", as well as other executions.) The evaluation of a function call dynamically encloses the execution of the <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.1#S0166">sequence_of_statements</a></code> of the function <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0089">body</a></code> (during that execution). Note that, due to recursion, several simultaneous executions of the same construct can be occurring at once during the execution of a particular task.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Dynamically enclosing is not defined across task boundaries; a task's execution does not include the execution of any other tasks.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Dynamically enclosing is only defined for executions that are occurring at a given moment in time; if an <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.3#S0175">if_statement</a></code> is currently executing the <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.1#S0166">sequence_of_statements</a></code> after <strong>then</strong>, then the evaluation of the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5#S0150">condition</a></code> is no longer dynamically enclosed by the execution of the <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.3#S0175">if_statement</a></code> (or anything else). </p></Admonition>

<p>When an exception occurrence is raised by the execution of a given construct, the rest of the execution of that construct is <em>abandoned</em>; that is, any portions of the execution that have not yet taken place are not performed. The construct is first completed, and then left, as explained in 7.6.1. Then: </p>
<p>If the construct is a <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.1#S0248">task_body</a></code>, the exception does not propagate further; </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>When an exception is raised by the execution of a <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.1#S0248">task_body</a></code>, there is no dynamically enclosing execution, so the exception does not propagate any further. If the exception occurred during the activation of the task, then the activator raises Tasking_Error, as explained in 9.2, "Task Execution - Task Activation", but we don't define that as propagation; it's a special rule. Otherwise (the exception occurred during the execution of the <code><a href="../AA-11/AA-11.2#S0304">handled_sequence_of_statements</a></code> of the task), the task silently disappears. Thus, abnormal termination of tasks is not always considered to be an error. </p></Admonition>

<p>If the construct is the <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.1#S0166">sequence_of_statements</a></code> of a <code><a href="../AA-11/AA-11.2#S0304">handled_sequence_of_statements</a></code> that has a handler with a choice covering the exception, the occurrence is handled by that handler;</p>
<p>Otherwise, the occurrence is <em>propagated</em> to the innermost dynamically enclosing execution, which means that the occurrence is raised again in that context. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>As shorthands, we refer to the <em>propagation of an exception</em>, and the <em>propagation by a construct</em>, if the execution of the construct propagates an exception occurrence. </p></Admonition>

<p>When an occurrence is <em>handled</em> by a given handler, the <code><a href="../AA-11/AA-11.2#S0306">choice_parameter_specification</a></code>, if any, is first elaborated, which creates the choice parameter and initializes it to the occurrence. Then, the <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.1#S0166">sequence_of_statements</a></code> of the handler is executed; this execution replaces the abandoned portion of the execution of the <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.1#S0166">sequence_of_statements</a></code>. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00318-02"}</em>{"}"} This "replacement" semantics implies that the handler can do pretty much anything the abandoned sequence could do; for example, in a function, the handler can execute a return statement that applies to the function. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>The rules for exceptions raised in library units, main subprograms and partitions follow from the normal rules, plus the semantics of the environment task described in Clause 10 (for example, the environment task of a partition elaborates library units and calls the main subprogram). If an exception is propagated by the main subprogram, it is propagated to the environment task, which then terminates abnormally, causing the partition to terminate abnormally. Although abnormal termination of tasks is not necessarily an error, abnormal termination of a partition due to an exception <em>is</em> an error. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 1   Note that exceptions raised in a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code> of a body are not handled by the handlers of the <code><a href="../AA-11/AA-11.2#S0304">handled_sequence_of_statements</a></code> of that body. </p></Admonition>

<p>Each distinct exception is represented by a distinct value of type Exception_Id. Null_Id does not represent any exception, and is the default initial value of type Exception_Id. Each occurrence of an exception is represented by a value of type Exception_Occurrence. Null_Occurrence does not represent any exception occurrence, and is the default initial value of type Exception_Occurrence.</p>
<p>For a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> E that denotes an exception, the following attribute is defined: </p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>In a distributed program, the identity is unique across an entire program, not just across a single partition. Exception propagation works properly across RPC's.

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00446-01"}</em>{"}"} Raise_Exception was changed so that it always raises an exception and thus can be a No_Return procedure. A similar change was not made for Reraise_Occurrence, as doing so was determined to be a significant incompatibility. It is not unusual to pass an Exception_Occurrence to other code to delay raising it. If there was no exception, passing Null_Occurrence works fine (nothing is raised). Moreover, as there is no test for Null_Occurrence in Ada 95, this is the only way to write such code without using additional flags. Breaking this sort of code is unacceptable. </p></Admonition>

<p>The Save_Occurrence procedure copies the Source to the Target. The Save_Occurrence function uses an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code> of type Exception_Occurrence_Access to create a new object, copies the Source to this new object, and returns an access value designating this new object; [the result may be deallocated using an instance of Unchecked_Deallocation.] </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} These routines are used to define the stream attributes (see 13.13.2) for Exception_Occurrence.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The identity of the exception, as well as the Exception_Name and Exception_Message, have to be preserved across partitions.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The string returned by Exception_Name or Exception_Message on the result of calling the Read attribute on a given stream has to be the same as the value returned by calling the corresponding function on the exception occurrence that was written into the stream with the Write attribute. The string returned by Exception_Information need not be the same, since it is implementation defined anyway. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>This is important for supporting writing exception occurrences to external files for post-mortem analysis, as well as propagating exceptions across remote subprogram calls in a distributed system (see E.4). </p></Admonition>

<p><em>Paragraph 16 was deleted.</em> </p>

#### Implementation Permissions

<p>An implementation of Exception_Name in a space-constrained environment may return the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.1#S0022">defining_identifier</a></code> instead of the full expanded name.</p>
<p>The string returned by Exception_Message may be truncated (to no less than 200 characters) by the Save_Occurrence procedure [(not the function)], the Reraise_Occurrence procedure, and the re-raise statement. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>The reason for allowing truncation is to ease implementations. The reason for choosing the number 200 is that this is the minimum source line length that implementations have to support, and this feature seems vaguely related since it's usually a "one-liner". Note that an implementation is allowed to do this truncation even if it supports arbitrarily long lines. </p></Admonition>


#### Implementation Advice

<p>Exception_Message (by default) and Exception_Information should produce information useful for debugging. Exception_Message should be short (about one line), whereas Exception_Information can be long. Exception_Message should not include the Exception_Name. Exception_Information should include both the Exception_Name and the Exception_Message.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-advice" title="Implementation Advice">
<p><strong></strong>Exception_Information should provide information useful for debugging, and should include the Exception_Name and Exception_Message.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-advice" title="Implementation Advice">
<p><strong></strong>Exception_Message by default should be short, provide information useful for debugging, and should not include the Exception_Name.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>It may seem strange to define two subprograms whose semantics is implementation defined. The idea is that a program can print out debugging/error-logging information in a portable way. The program is portable in the sense that it will work in any implementation; it might print out different information, but the presumption is that the information printed out is appropriate for debugging/error analysis on that system. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<p><strong></strong>As an example, Exception_Information might include information identifying the location where the exception occurred, and, for predefined exceptions, the specific kind of language-defined check that failed. There is an implementation trade-off here, between how much information is represented in an Exception_Occurrence, and how much can be passed through a re-raise.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The string returned should be in a form suitable for printing to an error log file. This means that it might need to contain line-termination control characters with implementation-defined I/O semantics. The string should neither start nor end with a newline.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>If an implementation chooses to provide additional functionality related to exceptions and their occurrences, it should do so by providing one or more children of Ada.Exceptions.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Note that exceptions behave as if declared at library level; there is no "natural scope" for an exception; an exception always exists. Hence, there is no harm in saving an exception occurrence in a data structure, and reraising it later. The reraise has to occur as part of the same program execution, so saving an exception occurrence in a file, reading it back in from a different program execution, and then reraising it is not required to work. This is similar to I/O of access types. Note that it is possible to use RPC to propagate exceptions across partitions.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Here's one way to implement Exception_Occurrence in the private part of the package. Using this method, an implementation need store only the actual number of characters in exception messages. If the user always uses small messages, then exception occurrences can be small. If the user never uses messages, then exception occurrences can be smaller still: </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
type Exception_Occurrence(Message_Length : Natural := 200) is{"\n"}    limited record{"\n"}        Id : Exception_Id;{"\n"}        Message : String(1..Message_Length);{"\n"}    end record;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>At the point where an exception is raised, an Exception_Occurrence can be allocated on the stack with exactly the right amount of space for the message - none for an empty message. This is just like declaring a constrained object of the type: </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
Temp : Exception_Occurrence(10); -- for a 10-character message{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>After finding the appropriate handler, the stack can be cut back, and the Temp copied to the right place. This is similar to returning an unknown-sized object from a function. It is not necessary to allocate the maximum possible size for every Exception_Occurrence. If, however, the user declares an Exception_Occurrence object, the discriminant will be permanently set to 200. The Save_Occurrence procedure would then truncate the Exception_Message. Thus, nothing is lost until the user tries to save the occurrence. If the user is willing to pay the cost of heap allocation, the Save_Occurrence function can be used instead.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Note that any arbitrary-sized implementation-defined Exception_Information can be handled in a similar way. For example, if the Exception_Occurrence includes a stack traceback, a discriminant can control the number of stack frames stored. The traceback would be truncated or entirely deleted by the Save_Occurrence procedure - as the implementation sees fit.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>If the internal representation involves pointers to data structures that might disappear, it would behoove the implementation to implement it as a controlled type, so that assignment can either copy the data structures or else null out the pointers. Alternatively, if the data structures being pointed at are in a task control block, the implementation could keep a unique sequence number for each task, so it could tell when a task's data structures no longer exist.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Using the above method, heap space is never allocated unless the user calls the Save_Occurrence function.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>An alternative implementation would be to store the message strings on the heap when the exception is raised. (It could be the global heap, or it could be a special heap just for this purpose - it doesn't matter.)  This representation would be used only for choice parameters. For normal user-defined exception occurrences, the Save_Occurrence procedure would copy the message string into the occurrence itself, truncating as necessary. Thus, in this implementation, Exception_Occurrence would be implemented as a variant record: </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
type Exception_Occurrence_Kind is (Normal, As_Choice_Param);{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock>
type Exception_Occurrence(Kind : Exception_Occurrence_Kind := Normal) is{"\n"}    limited record{"\n"}        case Kind is{"\n"}            when Normal ={">"}{"\n"}                ... -- space for 200 characters{"\n"}            when As_Choice_Param ={">"}{"\n"}                ... -- pointer to heap string{"\n"}        end case;{"\n"}    end record;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Exception_Occurrences created by the run-time system during exception raising would be As_Choice_Param. User-declared ones would be Normal - the user cannot see the discriminant, and so cannot set it to As_Choice_Param. The strings in the heap would be freed upon completion of the handler.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>This alternative implementation corresponds to a heap-based implementation of functions returning unknown-sized results.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">

#### Inconsistencies With Ada 95

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00241-01"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Amendment </strong> Exception_Identity of an Exception_Occurrence now is defined to return Null_Id for Null_Occurrence, rather than raising Constraint_Error. This provides a simple way to test for Null_Occurrence. We expect that programs that need Constraint_Error raised will be very rare; they can be easily fixed by explicitly testing for Null_Id or by using Exception_Name instead.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00378-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00417-01"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Amendment </strong> We now define the lower bound of the string returned from [[Wide_]Wide_]Exception_Name, Exception_Message, and Exception_Information. This makes working with the returned string easier, and is consistent with many other string-returning functions in Ada. This is technically an inconsistency; if a program depended on some other lower bound for the string returned from one of these functions, it could fail when compiled with Ada 2005. Such code is not portable even between Ada 95 implementations, so it should be very rare.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00446-01"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Amendment </strong> Raise_Exception now raises Constraint_Error if passed Null_Id. This means that it always raises an exception, and thus we can apply pragma No_Return to it. We expect that programs that call Raise_Exception with Null_Id will be rare, and programs that do that and expect no exception to be raised will be rarer; such programs can be easily fixed by explicitly testing for Null_Id before calling Raise_Exception. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00361-01"}</em>{"}"} The meaning of Exception_Message is reworded to reflect that the string can come from a <code><a href="../AA-11/AA-11.3#S0308">raise_statement</a></code> as well as a call of Raise_Exception.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00286-01"}</em>{"}"} The procedures Assertions.Assert have these effects independently of the assertion policy in effect.</p>

#### Bounded (Run-Time) Errors

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0274-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0439-1"}</em>{"}"} It is a bounded error to invoke a potentially blocking operation (see 9.5.1) during the evaluation of an assertion expression associated with a call on, or return from, a protected operation. If the bounded error is detected, Program_Error is raised. If not detected, execution proceeds normally, but if it is invoked within a protected action, it can result in deadlock or a (nested) protected action. </p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>This permission is intended to allow implementations which had an implementation-defined Assert pragma to continue to use their originally defined exception. Without this permission, such an implementation would be incorrect, as Exception_Name would return the wrong name. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00286-01"}</em>{"}"} Implementations may define their own assertion policies.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0274-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0445-1"}</em>{"}"} If the result of a function call in an assertion is not used to determine the value of the assertion expression, an implementation is permitted to omit the function call. [This permission applies even if the function has side effects.]</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0274-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0444-1"}</em>{"}"} An implementation may disallow the specification of an assertion expression if the evaluation of the expression has a side effect such that an immediate reevaluation of the expression can produce a different value. Similarly, an implementation may disallow the specification of an assertion expression that is checked as part of a call on or return from a callable entity <em>C</em>, if the evaluation of the expression has a side effect such that the evaluation of some other assertion expression associated with the same call of (or return from) <em>C</em> can produce a different value than in the case when the first expression had not been evaluated. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>This allows an implementation to reject such assertions. To maximize portability, assertions should not include expressions that contain these sorts of side effects. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>The intended effect of the second part of the rule (the part starting with "Similarly") is that an evaluation of the involved assertion expressions (subtype predicates, type invariants, preconditions and postconditions) in any order yields identical results.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>The rule is intended to apply to all of the assertion expressions that are evaluated at the start of call (and similarly for the assertion expressions that are evaluated during the return from a call), but not other assertions actually given in the body, nor between the assertions checked at the start and end of the call. Specifically, a side effect that alters a variable in a function called from a precondition expression that changes the result of a postcondition expression of the same subprogram does <em>not</em> trigger these rules unless it also changes the value of a reevaluation of the precondition expression. </p></Admonition>


#### Language Design Principles

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} Our intent is that any assertion expression that violates this Implementation Permission is considered pathological. We definitely want compilers to be able to assume that if you evaluate an assertion expression once and it is True, you don't need to evaluate it again if all you are doing in the meantime is evaluating assertion expressions. We were unable to find wording that had this effect that didn't throw out important other cases (logging, memo functions), so we settled for a strong warning that compilers can reject such pathologies. Perhaps in a future version of Ada we'll be able to tighten this up. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 1   {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00286-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0442-1"}</em>{"}"} Normally, the boolean expression in a <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> Assert does not call functions that have significant side effects when the result of the expression is True, so that the particular assertion policy in effect will not affect normal operation of the program. </p></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 95

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00286-01"}</em>{"}"} Pragmas Assert and Assertion_Policy, and package Assertions are new. </p></Admonition>


#### Incompatibilities With Ada 2005

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0274-1"}</em>{"}"} There now is an Implementation Permission to reject an assertion expression that calls a function that has a side effect such that an immediate reevalution of the expression could produce a different value. This means that a <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> Assert that works in Ada 2005 might be illegal in Ada 2012 in the unlikely event that the compiler detected such an error. This should be unlikely to occur in practice and it is considered a good thing, as the original expression was tricky and probably was not portable (as order of evaluation is unspecified within an expression). Moreover, no compiler is <em>required</em> to reject such expressions, so there is no need for any compiler to change behavior. </p></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 2005

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0290-1"}</em>{"}"} Assertion_Policy pragmas are now allowed in more places and can specify behavior for individual kinds of assertions. </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2012

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0112-1"}</em>{"}"} Added wording that preconditions and predicates given on language-defined units are always checked unless suppressed (that is, they act like language-defined checks). This is not considered an inconsistency, since there are no such preconditions or predicates in Ada 2012.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0179-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0265-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong></strong> Added wording that postconditions, type invariants, and default initial conditions given on language-defined units cannot fail. This is not considered an inconsistency, since there are no such postconditions, invariants, or default initial conditions in Ada 2012.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0265-1"}</em>{"}"} Added default initial conditions to the kinds of assertions (see 7.3.3).</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0396-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong></strong> Added a definition of assertion aspects, used in some freezing rules (see 13.14). </p></Admonition>
