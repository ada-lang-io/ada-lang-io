<p>A <em>generic unit</em> is a program unit that is either a generic subprogram or a generic package. A generic unit is a <em>template</em>[, which can be parameterized, and from which corresponding (nongeneric) subprograms or packages can be obtained]. The resulting program units are said to be <em>instances</em> of the original generic unit. <br /></p>

<strong>Term entry: </strong><strong>generic unit</strong> &mdash; template for a (nongeneric) program unit<br />Note 1: The template can be parameterized by objects, types, subprograms, and packages.<br />Note 2: Generic units can be used to perform the role that macros sometimes play in other languages.<br /></Admonition>

<p>[A generic unit is declared by a <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.1#S0310">generic_declaration</a></code>. This form of declaration has a <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.1#S0313">generic_formal_part</a></code> declaring any generic formal parameters. An instance of a generic unit is obtained as the result of a <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0315">generic_instantiation</a></code> with appropriate generic actual parameters for the generic formal parameters. An instance of a generic subprogram is a subprogram. An instance of a generic package is a package.<br /></p>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>Generic units are templates. As templates they do not have the properties that are specific to their nongeneric counterparts. For example, a generic subprogram can be instantiated but it cannot be called. In contrast, an instance of a generic subprogram is a (nongeneric) subprogram; hence, this instance can be called but it cannot be used to produce further instances.] <br /></p>
