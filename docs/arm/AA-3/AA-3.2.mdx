<p>A <em>type</em> is characterized by a set of values, and a set of <em>primitive operations</em> which implement the fundamental aspects of its semantics. An <em>object</em> of a given type is a run-time entity that contains (has) a value of the type. <br /></p>

<p>A subtype is called an <em>unconstrained</em> subtype if its type has unknown discriminants, or if its type allows range, index, or discriminant constraints, but the subtype does not impose such a constraint; otherwise, the subtype is called a <em>constrained</em> subtype (since it has no unconstrained characteristics). <br /></p>

NOTE   {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Any set of types can be called a "category" of types, and any set of types that is closed under derivation (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.4">3.4</a>) can be called a "class" of types. However, only certain categories and classes are used in the description of the rules of the language - generally those that have their own particular set of primitive operations (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#Subclause_3.2.3">3.2.3</a>), or that correspond to a set of types that are matched by a given kind of generic formal type (see <a href="../AA-12/AA-12.5">12.5</a>). The following are examples of "interesting" <em>language-defined classes</em>: elementary, scalar, discrete, enumeration, character, boolean, integer, signed integer, modular, real, floating point, fixed point, ordinary fixed point, decimal fixed point, numeric, access, access-to-object, access-to-subprogram, composite, array, string, (untagged) record, tagged, task, protected, nonlimited.

{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0301-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Predicate checks are now performed on default-initialized objects with parts that have Default_Value or Default_Component_Value specified. This is consistent with the handling of constraint checks for such objects; it is thought that the omission was unintended. However, a program that declares such an object and depends on there not being a predicate check in original Ada 2012 will fail in Ada 2022. As these attributes were new in Ada 2012, their use is uncommon, so we believe that this inconsistency will be rare and more likely to catch a bug than create one. <br /></Admonition>
