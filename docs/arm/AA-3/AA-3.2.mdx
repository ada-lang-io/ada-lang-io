#### Static Semantics

<p>A <em>type</em> is characterized by a set of values, and a set of <em>primitive operations</em> which implement the fundamental aspects of its semantics. An <em>object</em> of a given type is a run-time entity that contains (has) a value of the type. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<p><strong></strong>Each object has a type. A <em>type</em> has an associated set of values, and a set of <em>primitive operations</em> which implement the fundamental aspects of its semantics. Types are grouped into <em>categories</em>. Most language-defined categories of types are also <em>classes</em> of types.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<p><strong></strong>A subtype is a type together with optional constraints, null exclusions, and predicates, which constrain the values of the subtype to satisfy certain conditions. The values of a subtype are a subset of the values of its type.</p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} Types are grouped into <em>categories</em> of types. There exist several <em>language-defined categories</em> of types (see NOTES below), reflecting the similarity of their values and primitive operations. [Most categories of types form <em>classes</em> of types.] <em>Elementary</em> types are those whose values are logically indivisible; <em>composite</em> types are those whose values are composed of <em>component</em> values. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<p><strong></strong>A class is a set of types that is closed under derivation, which means that if a given type is in the class, then all types derived from that type are also in the class. The set of types of a class share common properties, such as their primitive operations.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<p><strong></strong>A category of types is a set of types with one or more common properties, such as primitive operations. A category of types that is closed under derivation is also known as a <em>class</em>.</p></Admonition>

<p>The elementary types are the <em>scalar</em> types (<em>discrete</em> and <em>real</em>) and the <em>access</em> types (whose values provide access to objects or subprograms). Discrete types are either <em>integer</em> types or are defined by enumeration of their values (<em>enumeration</em> types). Real types are either <em>floating point</em> types or <em>fixed point</em> types.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00251-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} The composite types are the <em>record</em> types, <em>record extensions</em>, <em>array</em> types, <em>interface</em> types, <em>task</em> types, and <em>protected</em> types. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><em>This paragraph was deleted.</em>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} There can be multiple views of a type with varying sets of operations. [An <em>incomplete</em> type represents an incomplete view (see 3.10.1) of a type with a very restricted usage, providing support for recursive data structures. A <em>private</em> type or <em>private extension</em> represents a partial view (see 7.3) of a type, providing support for data abstraction. The full view (see 3.2.1) of a type represents its complete definition.] An incomplete or partial view is considered a composite type[, even if the full view is not]. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>Proof: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} The real definitions of the views are in the referenced subclauses. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} Certain composite types (and views thereof) have special components called <em>discriminants</em> whose values affect the presence, constraints, or initialization of other components. Discriminants can be thought of as parameters of the type.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00366-01"}</em>{"}"} The term <em>subcomponent</em> is used in this Reference Manual in place of the term component to indicate either a component, or a component of another subcomponent. Where other subcomponents are excluded, the term component is used instead. Similarly, a <em>part</em> of an object or value is used to mean the whole object or value, or any set of its subcomponents. The terms component, subcomponent, and part are also applied to a type meaning the component, subcomponent, or part of objects and values of the type. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>The definition of "part" here is designed to simplify rules elsewhere. By design, the intuitive meaning of "part" will convey the correct result to the casual reader, while this formalistic definition will answer the concern of the compiler-writer.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>We use the term "part" when talking about the parent part, ancestor part, or extension part of a type extension. In contexts such as these, the part might represent an empty set of subcomponents (e.g. in a null record extension, or a nonnull extension of a null record). We also use "part" when specifying rules such as those that apply to an object with a "controlled part" meaning that it applies if the object as a whole is controlled, or any subcomponent is. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00231-01"}</em>{"}"} The set of possible values for an object of a given type can be subjected to a condition that is called a <em>constraint</em> (the case of a <em>null constraint</em> that specifies no restriction is also included)[; the rules for which values satisfy a given kind of constraint are given in 3.5 for <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.5#S0036">range_constraint</a></code>s, 3.6.1 for <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.6#S0057">index_constraint</a></code>s, and 3.7.1 for <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0064">discriminant_constraint</a></code>s]. The set of possible values for an object of an access type can also be subjected to a condition that excludes the null value (see 3.10).</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0140-1"}</em>{"}"} "Null constraint" includes the cases of no explicit constraint, as well as unknown discriminants and unconstrained array type declarations (which are explicit ways to declare no constraint). </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00231-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00415-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0445-1"}</em>{"}"} A <em>subtype</em> of a given type is a combination of the type, a constraint on values of the type, and certain attributes specific to the subtype. The given type is called the <em>type of the subtype</em>. Similarly, the associated constraint is called the <em>constraint of the subtype</em>.  The set of values of a subtype consists of the values of its type that satisfy its constraint and any exclusion of the null value. Such values <em>belong</em> to the subtype. The other values of the type are <em>outside</em> the subtype. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>We make a strong distinction between a type and its subtypes. In particular, a type is <em>not</em> a subtype of itself. There is no constraint associated with a type (not even a null one), and type-related attributes are distinct from subtype-specific attributes. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>We no longer use the term "base type." All types were "base types" anyway in Ada 83, so the term was redundant, and occasionally confusing. In the RM95 we say simply "the type <em>of</em> the subtype" instead of "the base type of the subtype." </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>The value subset for a subtype might be empty, and need not be a proper subset. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} Any name of a category of types (such as "discrete", "real", or "limited") is also used to qualify its subtypes, as well as its objects, values, declarations, and definitions, such as an "integer type declaration" or an "integer value". In addition, if a term such as "parent subtype" or "index subtype" is defined, then the corresponding term for the type of the subtype is "parent type" or "index type". </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>We use these corresponding terms without explicitly defining them, when the meaning is obvious. </p></Admonition>

<p>A subtype is called an <em>unconstrained</em> subtype if its type has unknown discriminants, or if its type allows range, index, or discriminant constraints, but the subtype does not impose such a constraint; otherwise, the subtype is called a <em>constrained</em> subtype (since it has no unconstrained characteristics). </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>In an earlier version of Ada 9X, "constrained" meant "has a nonnull constraint." However, we changed to this definition since we kept having to special case composite non-array/nondiscriminated types. It also corresponds better to the (now obsolescent) attribute 'Constrained.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>For scalar types, "constrained" means "has a nonnull constraint". For composite types, in implementation terms, "constrained" means that the size of all objects of the subtype is the same, assuming a typical implementation model.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Class-wide subtypes are always unconstrained. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE   {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} Any set of types can be called a "category" of types, and any set of types that is closed under derivation (see 3.4) can be called a "class" of types. However, only certain categories and classes are used in the description of the rules of the language - generally those that have their own particular set of primitive operations (see 3.2.3), or that correspond to a set of types that are matched by a given kind of generic formal type (see 12.5). The following are examples of "interesting" <em>language-defined classes</em>: elementary, scalar, discrete, enumeration, character, boolean, integer, signed integer, modular, real, floating point, fixed point, ordinary fixed point, decimal fixed point, numeric, access, access-to-object, access-to-subprogram, composite, array, string, (untagged) record, tagged, task, protected, nonlimited. Special syntax is provided to define types in each of these classes. In addition to these classes, the following are examples of "interesting" <em>language-defined categories</em>: abstract, incomplete, interface, limited, private, record. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>A <em>value</em> is a run-time entity with a given type which can be assigned to an object of an appropriate subtype of the type. An <em>operation</em> is a program entity that operates on zero or more operands to produce an effect, or yield a result, or both. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} Note that a type's category (and class) depends on the place of the reference - a private type is composite outside and possibly elementary inside. It's really the <em>view</em> that is elementary or composite. Note that although private types are composite, there are some properties that depend on the corresponding full view - for example, parameter passing modes, and the constraint checks that apply in various places.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} Every property of types forms a category, but not every property of types represents a class. For example, the set of all abstract types does not form a class, because this set is not closed under derivation. Similarly, the set of all interface types does not form a class.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} The set of limited types does not form a class (since nonlimited types can inherit from limited interfaces), but the set of nonlimited types does. The set of tagged record types and the set of tagged private types do not form a class (because each of them can be extended to create a type of the other category); that implies that the set of record types and the set of private types also do not form a class (even though untagged record types and untagged private types do form a class). In all of these cases, we can talk about the category of the type; for instance, we can talk about the "category of limited types".</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} Normatively, the <em>language-defined classes</em> are those that are defined to be inherited on derivation by 3.4; other properties either aren't interesting or form categories, not classes. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} These language-defined categories are organized like this: </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} all types	elementary		scalar			discrete				enumeration					character					boolean					other enumeration				integer					signed integer					modular integer			real				floating point				fixed point					ordinary fixed point					decimal fixed point		access			access-to-object			access-to-subprogram	composite		untagged			array				string				other array			record			task			protected		tagged (including interfaces)			nonlimited tagged record			limited tagged				limited tagged record				synchronized tagged					tagged task					tagged protected</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} There are other categories, such as "numeric" and "discriminated", which represent other categorization dimensions, but do not fit into the above strictly hierarchical picture. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} Note that this is also true for some categories mentioned in the chart. The category "task" includes both untagged tasks and tagged tasks. Similarly for "protected", "limited", and "nonlimited" (note that limited and nonlimited are not shown for untagged composite types). </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} This subclause now precedes the subclauses on objects and named numbers, to cut down on the number of forward references.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>We have dropped the term "base type" in favor of simply "type" (all types in Ada 83 were "base types" so it wasn't clear when it was appropriate/necessary to say "base type"). Given a subtype S of a type T, we call T the "type of the subtype S." </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00231-01"}</em>{"}"} Added a mention of null exclusions when we're talking about constraints (these are not constraints, but they are similar).</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00251-01"}</em>{"}"} Defined an interface type to be a composite type.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} Revised the wording so that it is clear that an incomplete view is similar to a partial view in terms of the language.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00366-01"}</em>{"}"} Added a definition of component of a type, subcomponent of a type, and part of a type. These are commonly used in the standard, but they were not previously defined.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} Reworded most of this subclause to use category rather than class, since so many interesting properties are not, strictly speaking, classes. Moreover, there was no normative description of exactly which properties formed classes, and which did not. The real definition of class, along with a list of properties, is now in 3.4. </p></Admonition>

The <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0061">known_discriminant_part</a></code>, if any, defines the discriminants of the type (see 3.7, "Discriminants"). The remainder of the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0023">type_declaration</a></code> defines the remaining characteristics of (the view of) the type.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00230-01"}</em>{"}"} A type defined by a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0023">type_declaration</a></code> is a <em>named</em> type; such a type has one or more nameable subtypes. Certain other forms of declaration also include type definitions as part of the declaration for an object. The type defined by such a declaration is <em>anonymous</em> - it has no nameable subtypes. For explanatory purposes, this document sometimes refers to an anonymous type by a pseudo-name, written in italics, and uses such pseudo-names at places where the syntax normally requires an <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.3#S0002">identifier</a></code>.

<p>The elaboration of a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> consists of the elaboration of the full type definition. Each elaboration of a full type definition creates a distinct type and its first subtype. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>The creation is associated with the type <em>definition</em>, rather than the type <em>declaration</em>, because there are types that are created by full type definitions that are not immediately contained within a type declaration (e.g. an array object declaration, a singleton task declaration, etc.). </p></Admonition>

Although names do not directly denote types, a phrase like "the type Column" is sometimes used in this document to refer to the type of Column, where Column denotes the first subtype of the type. For an example of the definition of an anonymous type, see the declaration of the array Color_Table in 3.3.1; its type is anonymous - it has no nameable subtypes. </p></Admonition>

#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00416-01"}</em>{"}"} An operation <em>operates on a type</em> <em>T</em> if it yields a value of type <em>T</em>, if it has an operand whose expected type (see 8.6) is <em>T</em>, or if it has an access parameter or access result type (see 6.1) designating <em>T</em>. A predefined operator, or other language-defined operation such as assignment or a membership test, that operates on a type, is called a <em>predefined operation</em> of the type. The <em>primitive operations</em> of a type are the predefined operations of the type, plus any user-defined primitive subprograms. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<p><strong></strong>The primitive operations of a type are the operations (such as subprograms) declared together with the type declaration. They are inherited by other types in the same class of types. For a tagged type, the primitive subprograms are dispatching subprograms, providing run-time polymorphism. A dispatching subprogram may be called with statically tagged operands, in which case the subprogram body invoked is determined at compile time. Alternatively, a dispatching subprogram may be called using a dispatching call, in which case the subprogram body invoked is determined at run time.</p></Admonition>

<p>For a specific type declared immediately within a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.1#S0230">package_specification</a></code>, any subprograms (in addition to the enumeration literals) that are explicitly declared immediately within the same <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.1#S0230">package_specification</a></code> and that operate on the type;</p>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0333-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0432-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong></strong> Predicate checks are no longer made for any inbound <strong>out</strong> parameters nor for the target of an <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.2#S0173">assignment_statement</a></code> when it is a view conversion. The rule change for this is found in 4.6, so the inconsistency is documented there. </p></Admonition>
