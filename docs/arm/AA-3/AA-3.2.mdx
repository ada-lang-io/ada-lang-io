#### Static Semantics

<p>A <em>type</em> is characterized by a set of values, and a set of <em>primitive operations</em> which implement the fundamental aspects of its semantics. An <em>object</em> of a given type is a run-time entity that contains (has) a value of the type. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>Each object has a type. A <em>type</em> has an associated set of values, and a set of <em>primitive operations</em> which implement the fundamental aspects of its semantics. Types are grouped into <em>categories</em>. Most language-defined categories of types are also <em>classes</em> of types.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A subtype is a type together with optional constraints, null exclusions, and predicates, which constrain the values of the subtype to satisfy certain conditions. The values of a subtype are a subset of the values of its type.<br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Types are grouped into <em>categories</em> of types. There exist several <em>language-defined categories</em> of types (see NOTES below), reflecting the similarity of their values and primitive operations. [Most categories of types form <em>classes</em> of types.] <em>Elementary</em> types are those whose values are logically indivisible; <em>composite</em> types are those whose values are composed of <em>component</em> values. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="proof" title="Proof: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The formal definition of <em>category</em> and <em>class</em> is found in 3.4. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A class is a set of types that is closed under derivation, which means that if a given type is in the class, then all types derived from that type are also in the class. The set of types of a class share common properties, such as their primitive operations.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A category of types is a set of types with one or more common properties, such as primitive operations. A category of types that is closed under derivation is also known as a <em>class</em>.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>An elementary type is a type that does not have components.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A composite type may have components.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A scalar type is either a discrete type or a real type.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>An access type has values that designate aliased objects. Access types correspond to "pointer types" or "reference types" in some other languages.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A discrete type is either an integer type or an enumeration type. Discrete types may be used, for example, in <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.4#S0176">case_statement</a></code>s and as array indices.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A real type has values that are approximations of the real numbers. Floating point and fixed point types are real types.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>Integer types comprise the signed integer types and the modular types. A signed integer type has a base range that includes both positive and negative numbers, and has operations that may raise an exception when the result is outside the base range. A modular type has a base range whose lower bound is zero, and has operations with "wraparound" semantics. Modular types subsume what are called "unsigned types" in some other languages.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>An enumeration type is defined by an enumeration of its values, which may be named by identifiers or character literals.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A character type is an enumeration type whose values include characters.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A record type is a composite type consisting of zero or more named components, possibly of different types.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A record extension is a type that extends another type by adding additional components.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>An array type is a composite type whose components are all of the same type. Components are selected by indexing.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A task type is a composite type used to represent active entities which execute concurrently and which can communicate via queued task entries. The top-level task of a partition is called the environment task.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A protected type is a composite type whose components are accessible only through one of its protected operations which synchronize concurrent access by multiple tasks.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A private type gives a view of a type that reveals only some of its properties. The remaining properties are provided by the full view given elsewhere. Private types can be used for defining abstractions that hide unnecessary details from their clients.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A private extension is a type that extends another type, with the additional properties hidden from its clients.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>An incomplete type gives a view of a type that reveals only some of its properties. The remaining properties are provided by the full view given elsewhere. Incomplete types can be used for defining recursive data structures.<br /></Admonition>

<p>The elementary types are the <em>scalar</em> types (<em>discrete</em> and <em>real</em>) and the <em>access</em> types (whose values provide access to objects or subprograms). Discrete types are either <em>integer</em> types or are defined by enumeration of their values (<em>enumeration</em> types). Real types are either <em>floating point</em> types or <em>fixed point</em> types.<br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00251-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The composite types are the <em>record</em> types, <em>record extensions</em>, <em>array</em> types, <em>interface</em> types, <em>task</em> types, and <em>protected</em> types. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<em>This paragraph was deleted.</em>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />There can be multiple views of a type with varying sets of operations. [An <em>incomplete</em> type represents an incomplete view (see 3.10.1) of a type with a very restricted usage, providing support for recursive data structures. A <em>private</em> type or <em>private extension</em> represents a partial view (see 7.3) of a type, providing support for data abstraction. The full view (see 3.2.1) of a type represents its complete definition.] An incomplete or partial view is considered a composite type[, even if the full view is not]. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="proof" title="Proof: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The real definitions of the views are in the referenced subclauses. <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Certain composite types (and views thereof) have special components called <em>discriminants</em> whose values affect the presence, constraints, or initialization of other components. Discriminants can be thought of as parameters of the type.<br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00366-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The term <em>subcomponent</em> is used in this Reference Manual in place of the term component to indicate either a component, or a component of another subcomponent. Where other subcomponents are excluded, the term component is used instead. Similarly, a <em>part</em> of an object or value is used to mean the whole object or value, or any set of its subcomponents. The terms component, subcomponent, and part are also applied to a type meaning the component, subcomponent, or part of objects and values of the type. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>The definition of "part" here is designed to simplify rules elsewhere. By design, the intuitive meaning of "part" will convey the correct result to the casual reader, while this formalistic definition will answer the concern of the compiler-writer.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
We use the term "part" when talking about the parent part, ancestor part, or extension part of a type extension. In contexts such as these, the part might represent an empty set of subcomponents (e.g. in a null record extension, or a nonnull extension of a null record). We also use "part" when specifying rules such as those that apply to an object with a "controlled part" meaning that it applies if the object as a whole is controlled, or any subcomponent is. <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00231-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The set of possible values for an object of a given type can be subjected to a condition that is called a <em>constraint</em> (the case of a <em>null constraint</em> that specifies no restriction is also included)[; the rules for which values satisfy a given kind of constraint are given in 3.5 for <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.5#S0036">range_constraint</a></code>s, 3.6.1 for <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.6#S0057">index_constraint</a></code>s, and 3.7.1 for <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0064">discriminant_constraint</a></code>s]. The set of possible values for an object of an access type can also be subjected to a condition that excludes the null value (see 3.10).<br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0140-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />"Null constraint" includes the cases of no explicit constraint, as well as unknown discriminants and unconstrained array type declarations (which are explicit ways to declare no constraint). <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00231-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00415-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0445-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />A <em>subtype</em> of a given type is a combination of the type, a constraint on values of the type, and certain attributes specific to the subtype. The given type is called the <em>type of the subtype</em>. Similarly, the associated constraint is called the <em>constraint of the subtype</em>.  The set of values of a subtype consists of the values of its type that satisfy its constraint and any exclusion of the null value. Such values <em>belong</em> to the subtype. The other values of the type are <em>outside</em> the subtype. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>We make a strong distinction between a type and its subtypes. In particular, a type is <em>not</em> a subtype of itself. There is no constraint associated with a type (not even a null one), and type-related attributes are distinct from subtype-specific attributes. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>We no longer use the term "base type." All types were "base types" anyway in Ada 83, so the term was redundant, and occasionally confusing. In the RM95 we say simply "the type <em>of</em> the subtype" instead of "the base type of the subtype." <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>The value subset for a subtype might be empty, and need not be a proper subset. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Any name of a category of types (such as "discrete", "real", or "limited") is also used to qualify its subtypes, as well as its objects, values, declarations, and definitions, such as an "integer type declaration" or an "integer value". In addition, if a term such as "parent subtype" or "index subtype" is defined, then the corresponding term for the type of the subtype is "parent type" or "index type". <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>We use these corresponding terms without explicitly defining them, when the meaning is obvious. <br /></Admonition>

<p>A subtype is called an <em>unconstrained</em> subtype if its type has unknown discriminants, or if its type allows range, index, or discriminant constraints, but the subtype does not impose such a constraint; otherwise, the subtype is called a <em>constrained</em> subtype (since it has no unconstrained characteristics). <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>In an earlier version of Ada 9X, "constrained" meant "has a nonnull constraint." However, we changed to this definition since we kept having to special case composite non-array/nondiscriminated types. It also corresponds better to the (now obsolescent) attribute 'Constrained.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
For scalar types, "constrained" means "has a nonnull constraint". For composite types, in implementation terms, "constrained" means that the size of all objects of the subtype is the same, assuming a typical implementation model.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Class-wide subtypes are always unconstrained. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
NOTE   {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Any set of types can be called a "category" of types, and any set of types that is closed under derivation (see 3.4) can be called a "class" of types. However, only certain categories and classes are used in the description of the rules of the language - generally those that have their own particular set of primitive operations (see 3.2.3), or that correspond to a set of types that are matched by a given kind of generic formal type (see 12.5). The following are examples of "interesting" <em>language-defined classes</em>: elementary, scalar, discrete, enumeration, character, boolean, integer, signed integer, modular, real, floating point, fixed point, ordinary fixed point, decimal fixed point, numeric, access, access-to-object, access-to-subprogram, composite, array, string, (untagged) record, tagged, task, protected, nonlimited. Special syntax is provided to define types in each of these classes. In addition to these classes, the following are examples of "interesting" <em>language-defined categories</em>: abstract, incomplete, interface, limited, private, record. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>A <em>value</em> is a run-time entity with a given type which can be assigned to an object of an appropriate subtype of the type. An <em>operation</em> is a program entity that operates on zero or more operands to produce an effect, or yield a result, or both. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Note that a type's category (and class) depends on the place of the reference - a private type is composite outside and possibly elementary inside. It's really the <em>view</em> that is elementary or composite. Note that although private types are composite, there are some properties that depend on the corresponding full view - for example, parameter passing modes, and the constraint checks that apply in various places.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Every property of types forms a category, but not every property of types represents a class. For example, the set of all abstract types does not form a class, because this set is not closed under derivation. Similarly, the set of all interface types does not form a class.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The set of limited types does not form a class (since nonlimited types can inherit from limited interfaces), but the set of nonlimited types does. The set of tagged record types and the set of tagged private types do not form a class (because each of them can be extended to create a type of the other category); that implies that the set of record types and the set of private types also do not form a class (even though untagged record types and untagged private types do form a class). In all of these cases, we can talk about the category of the type; for instance, we can talk about the "category of limited types".<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Normatively, the <em>language-defined classes</em> are those that are defined to be inherited on derivation by 3.4; other properties either aren't interesting or form categories, not classes. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />These language-defined categories are organized like this: <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />all types<br />	elementary<br />		scalar<br />			discrete<br />				enumeration<br />					character<br />					boolean<br />					other enumeration<br />				integer<br />					signed integer<br />					modular integer<br />			real<br />				floating point<br />				fixed point<br />					ordinary fixed point<br />					decimal fixed point<br />		access<br />			access-to-object<br />			access-to-subprogram<br />	composite<br />		untagged<br />			array<br />				string<br />				other array<br />			record<br />			task<br />			protected<br />		tagged (including interfaces)<br />			nonlimited tagged record<br />			limited tagged<br />				limited tagged record<br />				synchronized tagged<br />					tagged task<br />					tagged protected<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />There are other categories, such as "numeric" and "discriminated", which represent other categorization dimensions, but do not fit into the above strictly hierarchical picture. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Note that this is also true for some categories mentioned in the chart. The category "task" includes both untagged tasks and tagged tasks. Similarly for "protected", "limited", and "nonlimited" (note that limited and nonlimited are not shown for untagged composite types). <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />This subclause now precedes the subclauses on objects and named numbers, to cut down on the number of forward references.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
We have dropped the term "base type" in favor of simply "type" (all types in Ada 83 were "base types" so it wasn't clear when it was appropriate/necessary to say "base type"). Given a subtype S of a type T, we call T the "type of the subtype S." <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00231-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Added a mention of null exclusions when we're talking about constraints (these are not constraints, but they are similar).<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00251-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Defined an interface type to be a composite type.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Revised the wording so that it is clear that an incomplete view is similar to a partial view in terms of the language.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00366-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Added a definition of component of a type, subcomponent of a type, and part of a type. These are commonly used in the standard, but they were not previously defined.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Reworded most of this subclause to use category rather than class, since so many interesting properties are not, strictly speaking, classes. Moreover, there was no normative description of exactly which properties formed classes, and which did not. The real definition of class, along with a list of properties, is now in 3.4. <br /></Admonition>

#### Legality Rules

<p>A given type shall not have a subcomponent whose type is the given type itself. <br /></p>


#### Static Semantics

<p>The <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.1#S0022">defining_identifier</a></code> of a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0023">type_declaration</a></code> denotes the <em>first subtype</em> of the type. The <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0061">known_discriminant_part</a></code>, if any, defines the discriminants of the type (see 3.7, "Discriminants"). The remainder of the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0023">type_declaration</a></code> defines the remaining characteristics of (the view of) the type.<br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00230-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />A type defined by a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0023">type_declaration</a></code> is a <em>named</em> type; such a type has one or more nameable subtypes. Certain other forms of declaration also include type definitions as part of the declaration for an object. The type defined by such a declaration is <em>anonymous</em> - it has no nameable subtypes. For explanatory purposes, this document sometimes refers to an anonymous type by a pseudo-name, written in italics, and uses such pseudo-names at places where the syntax normally requires an <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.3#S0002">identifier</a></code>. For a named type whose first subtype is T, this document sometimes refers to the type of T as simply "the type T". <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00230-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The only user-defined types that can be anonymous in the above sense are array, access, task, and protected types. An anonymous array, task, or protected type can be defined as part of an <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.3#S0032">object_declaration</a></code>. An anonymous access type can be defined as part of numerous other constructs. <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00230-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />A named type that is declared by a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code>, or an anonymous type that is defined by an <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#S0084">access_definition</a></code> or as part of declaring an object of the type, is called a <em>full type</em>. The declaration of a full type also declares the <em>full view</em> of the type. The <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0025">type_definition</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.1#S0246">task_definition</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.4#S0251">protected_definition</a></code>, or <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#S0084">access_definition</a></code> that defines a full type is called a <em>full type definition</em>. [Types declared by other forms of <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0023">type_declaration</a></code> are not separate types; they are partial or incomplete views of some full type.] <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>Class-wide, universal, and root numeric types are full types. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00230-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />We need to mention <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#S0084">access_definition</a></code> separately, as it may occur in renames, which do not declare objects. <br /></Admonition>

<p>The definition of a type implicitly declares certain <em>predefined operators</em> that operate on the type, according to what classes the type belongs, as specified in 4.5, "Operators and Expression Evaluation". <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>We no longer talk about the implicit declaration of basic operations. These are treated like an <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.3#S0175">if_statement</a></code> - they don't need to be declared, but are still applicable to only certain classes of types.<br /></Admonition>

<p>The <em>predefined types</em> [(for example the types Boolean, Wide_Character, Integer, <em>root_integer</em>, and <em>universal_integer</em>)] are the types that are defined in [a predefined library package called] Standard[; this package also includes the [(implicit)] declarations of their predefined operators]. [The package Standard is described in A.1.] <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>We use the term "predefined" to refer to entities declared in the visible part of Standard, to implicitly declared operators of a type whose semantics are defined by the language, to Standard itself, and to the "predefined environment". We do not use this term to refer to library packages other than Standard. For example Text_IO is a language-defined package, not a predefined package, and Text_IO.Put_Line is not a predefined operation. <br /></Admonition>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<p>The elaboration of a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> consists of the elaboration of the full type definition. Each elaboration of a full type definition creates a distinct type and its first subtype. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>The creation is associated with the type <em>definition</em>, rather than the type <em>declaration</em>, because there are types that are created by full type definitions that are not immediately contained within a type declaration (e.g. an array object declaration, a singleton task declaration, etc.). <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>Any implicit declarations that occur immediately following the full type definition are elaborated where they (implicitly) occur. <br /></Admonition>


#### Examples

<p><em>Examples of type definitions:</em> <br /></p>

<CodeBlock>
(White, Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Brown, Black){"\n"}range 1 .. 72{"\n"}array(1 .. 10) of Integer{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<p><em>Examples of type declarations:</em> <br /></p>

<CodeBlock>
type Color  is (White, Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Brown, Black);{"\n"}type Column is range 1 .. 72;{"\n"}type Table  is array(1 .. 10) of Integer;{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
NOTE 1   Each of the above examples declares a named type. The identifier given denotes the first subtype of the type. Other named subtypes of the type can be declared with <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0026">subtype_declaration</a></code>s (see 3.2.2). Although names do not directly denote types, a phrase like "the type Column" is sometimes used in this document to refer to the type of Column, where Column denotes the first subtype of the type. For an example of the definition of an anonymous type, see the declaration of the array Color_Table in 3.3.1; its type is anonymous - it has no nameable subtypes. <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The syntactic category <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> now includes task and protected type declarations.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
We have generalized the concept of first-named subtype (now called simply "first subtype") to cover all kinds of types, for uniformity of description elsewhere. RM83 defined first-named subtype in Section 13. We define first subtype here, because it is now a more fundamental concept. We renamed the term, because in Ada 95 some first subtypes have no name.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00230-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />We no longer elaborate <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0059">discriminant_part</a></code>s, because there is nothing to do, and it was complex to say that you only wanted to elaborate it once for a private or incomplete type. This is also consistent with the fact that subprogram specifications are not elaborated (neither in Ada 83 nor in Ada 95). Note, however, that an <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#S0084">access_definition</a></code> appearing in a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0059">discriminant_part</a></code> is elaborated at the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0024">full_type_declaration</a></code> (for a nonlimited type) or when an object with such a discriminant is created (for a limited type). <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00230-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Added wording so that anonymous access types are always full types, even if they appear in renames.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">

#### Dynamic Semantics

The elaboration of a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0027">subtype_indication</a></code> creates a new subtype. If the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0027">subtype_indication</a></code> does not include a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0029">constraint</a></code>, the new subtype has the same (possibly null) constraint as that denoted by the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0028">subtype_mark</a></code>. The elaboration of a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0027">subtype_indication</a></code> that includes a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0029">constraint</a></code> proceeds as follows: <br /></p>

<ul>
<li>The <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0029">constraint</a></code> is first elaborated.<br /></li>
<li>A check is then made that the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0029">constraint</a></code> is <em>compatible</em> with the subtype denoted by the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0028">subtype_mark</a></code>. <br /></li>
</ul>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">

#### Incompatibilities With Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
In Ada 95, all <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.5#S0036">range_constraint</a></code>s cause freezing of their type.

#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0028">Subtype_mark</a></code>s allow only subtype names now, since types are never directly named. There is no need for RM83-3.3.2(3), which says a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0028">subtype_mark</a></code> can denote both the type and the subtype; in Ada 95, you denote an unconstrained (base) subtype if you want, but never the type.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">

## 3.2.3  Classification of Operations


#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00416-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />An operation <em>operates on a type</em> <em>T</em> if it yields a value of type <em>T</em>, if it has an operand whose expected type (see 8.6) is <em>T</em>, or if it has an access parameter or access result type (see 6.1) designating <em>T</em>. A predefined operator, or other language-defined operation such as assignment or a membership test, that operates on a type, is called a <em>predefined operation</em> of the type. The <em>primitive operations</em> of a type are the predefined operations of the type, plus any user-defined primitive subprograms. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>The primitive operations of a type are the operations (such as subprograms) declared together with the type declaration. They are inherited by other types in the same class of types. For a tagged type, the primitive subprograms are dispatching subprograms, providing run-time polymorphism. A dispatching subprogram may be called with statically tagged operands, in which case the subprogram body invoked is determined at compile time. Alternatively, a dispatching subprogram may be called using a dispatching call, in which case the subprogram body invoked is determined at run time.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>Protected subprograms are not considered to be "primitive subprograms", even though they are subprograms, and they are inherited by derived types. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>We use the term "primitive subprogram" in most of the rest of the manual. The term "primitive operation" is used mostly in conceptual discussions. <br /></Admonition>

<p>The <em>primitive subprograms</em> of a specific type are defined as follows: <br /></p>

<ul>
<li>The predefined operators of the type (see 4.5);<br /></li>
<li>For a derived type, the inherited (see 3.4) user-defined subprograms;<br /></li>
<li>For an enumeration type, the enumeration literals (which are considered parameterless functions - see 3.5.1);<br /></li>
<li>For a specific type declared immediately within a <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.1#S0230">package_specification</a></code>, any subprograms (in addition to the enumeration literals) that are explicitly declared immediately within the same <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.1#S0230">package_specification</a></code> and that operate on the type;<br /></li>
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0128-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />For a specific type with an explicitly declared primitive "=" operator whose result type is Boolean, the corresponding "/=" operator (see 6.6);<br /></li>
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00200-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />For a nonformal type, any subprograms not covered above [that are explicitly declared immediately within the same declarative region as the type] and that override (see 8.3) other implicitly declared primitive subprograms of the type. <br /></li>
</ul>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>In Ada 83, only subprograms declared in the visible part were "primitive" (i.e. derivable). In Ada 95, mostly because of child library units, we include all operations declared in the private part as well, and all operations that override implicit declarations. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>It is possible for a subprogram to be primitive for more than one type, though it is illegal for a subprogram to be primitive for more than one tagged type. See 3.9. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>The order of the implicit declarations when there are both predefined operators and inherited subprograms is described in 3.4, "Derived Types and Classes". <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00200-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Subprograms declared in a generic package specification are never primitive for a formal type, even if they happen to override an operation of the formal type. This includes formal subprograms, which are never primitive operations (that's true even for an abstract formal subprogram). <br /></Admonition>

<p>A primitive subprogram whose designator is an <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0202">operator_symbol</a></code> is called a <em>primitive operator</em>.<br /></p>


#### Incompatibilities With Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The attribute S'Base is no longer defined for nonscalar subtypes. Since this was only permitted as the prefix of another attribute, and there are no interesting nonscalar attributes defined for an unconstrained composite or access subtype, this should not affect any existing programs. <br /></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The primitive subprograms (derivable subprograms) include subprograms declared in the private part of a package specification as well, and those that override implicitly declared subprograms, even if declared in a body. <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">

{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00200-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Clarified that a formal subprogram that happens to override a primitive operation of a formal type is not a primitive operation (and thus not a dispatching operation) of the formal type.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00416-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />Added wording to include access result types in the kinds of operations that operate on a type T. <br /></Admonition>
