#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>A <em>type</em> is characterized by a set of values, and a set of <em>primitive operations</em> which implement the fundamental aspects of its semantics. An <em>object</em> of a given type is a run-time entity that contains (has) a value of the type. <br /></p>

<p>Types are grouped into <em>categories</em> of types. There exist several <em>language-defined categories</em> of types (summarized in the NOTE  below), reflecting the similarity of their values and primitive operations. [Most categories of types form <em>classes</em> of types.] <em>Elementary</em> types are those whose values are logically indivisible; <em>composite</em> types are those whose values are composed of <em>component</em> values. <br /></p>

<p>There can be multiple views of a type with varying sets of operations. [An <em>incomplete</em> type represents an incomplete view (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#Subclause_3.10.1">3.10.1</a>) of a type with a very restricted usage, providing support for recursive data structures. A <em>private</em> type or <em>private extension</em> represents a partial view (see <a href="../AA-7/AA-7.3">7.3</a>) of a type, providing support for data abstraction. The full view (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#Subclause_3.2.1">3.2.1</a>) of a type represents its complete definition.] An incomplete or partial view is considered a composite type[, even if the full view is not]. <br /></p>

<p>The term <em>subcomponent</em> is used in this Reference Manual in place of the term component to indicate either a component, or a component of another subcomponent. Where other subcomponents are excluded, the term component is used instead. Similarly, a <em>part</em> of an object or value is used to mean the whole object or value, or any set of its subcomponents. The terms component, subcomponent, and part are also applied to a type meaning the component, subcomponent, or part of objects and values of the type. <br /></p>

<p>A <em>subtype</em> of a given type is a combination of the type, a constraint on values of the type, and certain attributes specific to the subtype. The given type is called the <em>type of the subtype</em>. Similarly, the associated constraint is called the <em>constraint of the subtype</em>. The set of values of a subtype consists of the values of its type that satisfy its constraint and any exclusion of the null value. Such values <em>belong</em> to the subtype.

#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>1/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00416-01"]} />
<p>An operation <em>operates on a type</em> <em>T</em> if it yields a value of type <em>T</em>, if it has an operand whose expected type (see <a href="../AA-8/AA-8.6">8.6</a>) is <em>T</em>, or if it has an access parameter or access result type (see <a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1">6.1</a>) designating <em>T</em>. A predefined operator, or other language-defined operation such as assignment or a membership test, that operates on a type, is called a <em>predefined operation</em> of the type. The <em>primitive operations</em> of a type are the predefined operations of the type, plus any user-defined primitive subprograms. <br /></p>

<strong></strong> Predicate checks are now performed on default-initialized objects with parts that have Default_Value or Default_Component_Value specified. This is consistent with the handling of constraint checks for such objects; it is thought that the omission was unintended. However, a program that declares such an object and depends on there not being a predicate check in original Ada 2012 will fail in Ada 2022. As these attributes were new in Ada 2012, their use is uncommon, so we believe that this inconsistency will be rare and more likely to catch a bug than create one. <br /></Admonition>
