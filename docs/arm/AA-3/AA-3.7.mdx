<p>[ A composite type (other than an array or interface type) can have discriminants, which parameterize the type. A <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0061">known_discriminant_part</a></code> specifies the discriminants of a composite type. A discriminant of an object is a component of the object, and is either of a discrete type or an access type. An <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0060">unknown_discriminant_part</a></code> in the declaration of a view of a type specifies that the discriminants of the type are unknown for the given view; all subtypes of such a view are indefinite subtypes.] <br /></p>

#### Language Design Principles

<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00402-01"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
When an access discriminant is initialized at the time of object creation with an allocator of an anonymous type, the allocated object and the object with the discriminant are tied together for their lifetime. They should be allocated out of the same storage pool, and then at the end of the lifetime of the enclosing object, finalized and reclaimed together. In this case, the allocated object is called a coextension (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#Subclause_3.10.2">3.10.2</a>). <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>2.c/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<strong></strong>The above principle when applied to a nonlimited type implies that such an object may be copied only to a shorter-lived object, because attempting to assign it to a longer-lived object would fail because the access discriminants would not match. In a copy, the lifetime connection between the enclosing object and the allocated object does not exist. The allocated object is tied in the above sense only to the original object. Other copies have only secondary references to it.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>2.d/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Note that when an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code> appears as a constraint on an access discriminant in a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0027">subtype_indication</a></code> that is elaborated independently from object creation, no such connection exists. For example, if a named constrained subtype is declared via "<strong>subtype</strong> Constr <strong>is</strong> Rec(Acc_Discrim ={">"} <strong>new</strong> T);" or if such an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8#S0164">allocator</a></code> appears in the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0027">subtype_indication</a></code> for a component, the allocator is evaluated when the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0027">subtype_indication</a></code> is elaborated, and hence its lifetime is typically longer than the objects or components that will later be subject to the constraint. In these cases, the allocated object should not be reclaimed until the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0027">subtype_indication</a></code> goes out of scope. <br /></Admonition>

Defaults for discriminants of tagged types are disallowed so that every object of a nonlimited tagged type is constrained, either by an explicit constraint, or by its initial discriminant values. This substantially simplifies the semantic rules and the implementation of inherited dispatching operations. We don't need this rule for limited tagged types, as the discriminants of such objects cannot be changed after the object is created in any case &mdash; no full-object assignment is supported, and that is required to change discriminant values. For generic formal types, the restriction simplifies the type matching rules.

<strong></strong>We considered the following rules for access discriminants: <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>11.d</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>If a type has an access discriminant, this automatically makes it limited, just like having a limited component automatically makes a type limited. This was rejected because it decreases program readability, and because it seemed error prone (two bugs in a previous version of the RM9X were attributable to this rule).<br /></li>
<MarginText>11.e/2</MarginText>
<li>A type with an access discriminant shall be limited. This is equivalent to the rule we actually chose for Ada 95, except that it allows a type to have an access discriminant if it is limited just because of a limited component. For example, any record containing a task would be allowed to have an access discriminant, whereas the actual rule requires &ldquo;<strong>limited</strong> <strong>record</strong>&rdquo;. This rule was also rejected due to readability concerns, and because would interact badly with the rules for limited types that &ldquo;become nonlimited&rdquo;.<br /></li>
<MarginText>11.e.1/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0063-1"]} />
<li>A type may have an access discriminant if it is an immutably limited type. This was the rule chosen for Ada 95.<br /></li>
<MarginText>11.f/2</MarginText>
<li>Any type may have an access discriminant. For nonlimited type, there is no special accessibility for access discriminants; they're the same as any other anonymous access component. For a limited type, they have the special accessibility of Ada 95. However, this doesn't work because a limited partial view can have a nonlimited full view -- giving the two views different accessibility.<br /></li>
<MarginText>11.f.1/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0063-1"]} />
<li>Any type may have an access discriminant, as above. However, special accessibility rules only apply to types that are immutably limited (task, protected, and explicitly limited records). However, this breaks privacy; worse, Legality Rules depend on the definition of accessibility.<br /></li>
<MarginText>11.f.2/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0063-1"]} />
<li>Any type may have an access discriminant, as above. Limited types have special accessibility, while nonlimited types have normal accessibility. However, a limited partial view with an access discriminant can only be completed by an immutably limited type. That prevents accessibility from changing. A runtime accessibility check is required on generic formal types with access discriminants. However, changing between limited and nonlimited types would have far-reaching consequences for access discriminants &mdash; which is uncomfortable.<br /></li>
<MarginText>11.g/2</MarginText>
<li>Any type may have an access discriminant. All types have special accessibility. This was considered early during the Ada 9X process, but was dropped for &ldquo;unpleasant complexities&rdquo;, which unfortunately aren't recorded. It does seem that an accessibility check would be needed on assignment of such a type, to avoid copying an object with a discriminant pointing to a local object into a more global object (and thus creating a dangling pointer).<br /></li>
<MarginText>11.h/2</MarginText>
<li>Any type may have an access discriminant, but access discriminants cannot have defaults. All types have special accessibility. This gets rid of the problems on assignment (you couldn't change such a discriminant), but it would be horribly incompatible with Ada 95.<br /></li>
<MarginText>11.h.1/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0063-1"]} />
<li>Any type may have an access discriminant, but access discriminants may have defaults only if they are of an immutably limited type. This is the rule chosen for Ada 2005, as it is not incompatible, and it doesn't require weird accessibility checks. <br /></li>

#### Inconsistencies With Ada 83

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>15.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Dependent compatibility checks are no longer performed on subtype declaration. Instead they are deferred until object creation (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.3#Subclause_3.3.1">3.3.1</a>). This is upward compatible for a program that does not raise Constraint_Error. <br /></Admonition>

#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>15.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Everything in RM83-3.7.2(7-12), which specifies the initial values for discriminants, is now redundant with 3.3.1, 6.4.1, 8.5.1, and 12.4. Therefore, we don't repeat it here. Since the material is largely intuitive, but nevertheless complicated to state formally, it doesn't seem worth putting it in a "NOTE". <br /></Admonition>

#### Incompatibilities With Ada 95

<MarginText>15.c/2</MarginText>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
{"{"}<em>8652/0008</em>{"}"} The Corrigendum added a restriction on <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0064">discriminant_constraint</a></code>s for general access subtypes. Such constraints are prohibited if the designated type can be treated as constrained somewhere in the program. Ada 2005 goes further and prohibits such <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0064">discriminant_constraint</a></code>s if the designated type has (or might have, in the case of a formal type) defaults for its discriminants. The use of general access subtypes is rare, and this eliminates a boatload of problems that required many restrictions on the use of aliased objects and components (now lifted). Similarly, Ada 2005 prohibits <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0064">discriminant_constraint</a></code>s on any access type whose designated type has a partial view that is constrained. Such a type will not be constrained in the heap to avoid privacy problems. Again, the use of such subtypes is rare (they can only happen within the package and its child units). <br /></Admonition>

<a id="Subclause_3.7.2"></a>

## 3.7.2  Operations of Discriminated Types

<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>[If a discriminated type has <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code>s for its discriminants, then unconstrained variables of the type are permitted, and the discriminants of such a variable can be changed by assignment to the variable. For a formal parameter of such a type, an attribute is provided to determine whether the corresponding actual parameter is constrained or unconstrained.] <br /></p>


#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>For a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> A that is of a discriminated type [(after any implicit dereference)], the following attribute is defined: <br /></p>

<MarginText>3/5</MarginText>
<dt><br/>A'Constrained</dt>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0214-1", "AI12-0183-1"]} />

<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0214-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note">
<strong></strong>This attribute is primarily used on parameters, to determine whether the discriminants can be changed as part of an assignment. The Constrained attribute is statically True for <strong>in</strong> parameters. For <strong>in out</strong> and <strong>out</strong> parameters of a discriminated type, the value of this attribute needs to be passed as an implicit parameter, in general. However, if the type is tagged or does not have defaults for its discriminants, the attribute is statically True, so no implicit parameter is needed. Parameters of a limited untagged type with defaulted discriminants need this implicit parameter, unless there are no nonlimited views, because they might be passed to a subprogram whose body has visibility on a nonlimited view of the type, and hence might be able to assign to the object and change its discriminants. <br /></Admonition>

Such objects still cannot have their discriminants changed, as assignment is not supported for them, so there is no use for this attribute that would justify the overhead of passing it with all class-wide parameters. <br /></Admonition>

#### Erroneous Execution

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>The execution of a construct is erroneous if the construct has a constituent that is a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> denoting a subcomponent that depends on discriminants, and the value of any of these discriminants is changed by this execution between evaluating the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> and the last use (within this execution) of the subcomponent denoted by the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<strong></strong>This rule applies to <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.2#S0173">assignment_statement</a></code>s, calls (except when the discriminant-dependent subcomponent is an <strong>in</strong> parameter passed by copy), <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0096">indexed_component</a></code>s, and <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0097">slice</a></code>s. Ada 83 only covered the first two cases. AI83-00585 pointed out the situation with the last two cases. The cases of <code><a href="../AA-8/AA-8.5#S0239">object_renaming_declaration</a></code>s and generic formal <strong>in out</strong> objects are handled differently, by disallowing the situation at compile time. <br /></Admonition>

#### Extensions to Ada 83

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.b/1</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
For consistency with other attributes, we are allowing the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> of Constrained to be a value as well as an object of a discriminated type, and also an implicit dereference. These extensions are not important capabilities, but there seems no reason to make this attribute different from other similar attributes. We are curious what most Ada 83 compilers do with F(1).X'Constrained.<br /></Admonition>
