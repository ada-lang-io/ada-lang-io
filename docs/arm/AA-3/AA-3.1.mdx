<p>The language defines several kinds of named <em>entities</em> that are declared by declarations. The entity's <em>name</em> is defined by the declaration, usually by a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.1#S0022">defining_identifier</a></code>, but sometimes by a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.5#S0040">defining_character_literal</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0203">defining_operator_symbol</a></code>. There are also entities that are not directly declared; some of these are elements of other entities, or are allocated dynamically. Such entities can be denoted using <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0096">indexed_component</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0098">selected_component</a></code>, or dereference <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>s (see <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1">4.1</a>).<br /></p>

#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<p>A <em>declaration</em> is a language construct that associates a name with (a view of) an entity. A declaration may appear explicitly in the program text (an <em>explicit</em> declaration), or may be supposed to occur at a given place in the text as a consequence of the semantics of another construct (an <em>implicit</em> declaration). <br /></p>

<MarginText>5.a</MarginText>

<strong></strong>An implicit declaration generally declares a predefined or inherited operation associated with the definition of a type. This term is used primarily when allowing explicit declarations to override implicit declarations, as part of a type declaration. <br /></Admonition>

<p>All declarations contain a <em>definition</em> for a <em>view</em> of an entity. A view consists of an identification of the entity (the entity <em>of</em> the view), plus view-specific characteristics that affect the use of the entity through that view (such as mode of access to an object, formal parameter names and defaults for a subprogram, or visibility to components of a type). In most cases, a declaration also contains the definition for the entity itself (a <code><a href="../AA-8/AA-8.5#S0238">renaming_declaration</a></code> is an example of a declaration that does not define a new entity, but instead defines a view of an existing entity (see <a href="../AA-8/AA-8.5">8.5</a>)).<br /></p>

<p>For each declaration, the language rules define a certain region of text called the <em>scope</em> of the declaration (see <a href="../AA-8/AA-8.2">8.2</a>). Most declarations associate an <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.3#S0002">identifier</a></code> with a declared entity. Within its scope, and only there, there are places where it is possible to use the <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.3#S0002">identifier</a></code> to refer to the declaration, the view it defines, and the associated entity; these places are defined by the visibility rules (see <a href="../AA-8/AA-8.3">8.3</a>). At such places the <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.3#S0002">identifier</a></code> is said to be a <em>name</em> of the entity (the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0092">direct_name</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0099">selector_name</a></code>); the name is said to <em>denote</em> the declaration, the view, and the associated entity (see <a href="../AA-8/AA-8.6">8.6</a>). The declaration is said to <em>declare</em> the name, the view, and in most cases, the entity itself.<br /></p>

<MarginText>11</MarginText>
<p>As an alternative to an <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.3#S0002">identifier</a></code>, an enumeration literal can be declared with a <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.5#S0015">character_literal</a></code> as its name (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.5#Subclause_3.5.1">3.5.1</a>), and a function can be declared with an <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0202">operator_symbol</a></code> as its name (see <a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1">6.1</a>).<br /></p>

The phrase &ldquo;visible by selection&rdquo; is not used in Ada 95. It is subsumed by simply &ldquo;visible&rdquo; and the Name Resolution Rules for <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0099">selector_name</a></code>s.<br /></Admonition>

(Note that in Ada 95, a declaration is visible at all places where one could have used a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0099">selector_name</a></code>, not just at places where a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0099">selector_name</a></code> was actually used. Thus, the places where a declaration is directly visible are a subset of the places where it is visible. See Clause <a href="../AA-8/">8</a> for details.)<br /></Admonition>

We use the term &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; to cover <code>_specification</code>s that declare (views of) objects, such as <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0207">parameter_specification</a></code>s. In Ada 83, these are referred to as a &ldquo;form of declaration&rdquo;, but it is not entirely clear that they are considered simply &ldquo;declarations&rdquo;.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
RM83 contains an incomplete definition of "elaborated" in this subclause: it defines "elaborated" for declarations, <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code>s, <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0087">declarative_item</a></code>s and <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0286">compilation_unit</a></code>s, but "elaboration" is defined elsewhere for various other constructs. To make matters worse, Ada 95 has a different set of elaborable constructs. Instead of correcting the list, it is more maintainable to refer to the term "elaborable," which is defined in a distributed manner.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
RM83 uses the term &ldquo;has no other effect&rdquo; to describe an elaboration that doesn't do anything except change the state from not-yet-elaborated to elaborated. This was a confusing wording, because the answer to &ldquo;other than what?&rdquo; was to be found many pages away. In Ada 95, we change this wording to &ldquo;has no effect&rdquo; (for things that truly do nothing at run time), and &ldquo;has no effect other than to establish that so-and-so can happen without failing the Elaboration_Check&rdquo; (for things where it matters).<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
We make it clearer that the term "execution" covers elaboration and evaluation as special cases. This was implied in RM83. For example, "erroneous execution" can include any execution, and RM83-9.4(3) has, "The task designated by any other task object depends on the master whose execution creates the task object;" the elaboration of the master's <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code> is doing the task creation. <br /></Admonition>
