<p>A <em>class of types</em> is a set of types that is closed under derivation; that is, if the parent or a progenitor type of a derived type belongs to a class, then so does the derived type. By saying that a particular group of types forms a class, we are saying that all derivatives of a type in the set inherit the characteristics that define that set. The more general term <em>category of types</em> is used for a set of types whose defining characteristics are not necessarily inherited by derivatives; for example, limited, abstract, and interface are all categories of types, but not classes of types.<br /></p>

If the parent type is an untagged limited formal type with an actual type that is nonlimited, we allow derivation as a limited type in the private part or body as no place could have visibility on the resulting type where it was known to be nonlimited (outside of the instance). (See the previous paragraph's annotations for an explanation of this.) However, if the parent type is a tagged limited formal type with an actual type that is nonlimited, it would be possible to pass a value of the limited type extension to a class-wide type of the parent, which would be nonlimited. That's too weird to allow (even though all of the extension components would have to be nonlimited because the rules of <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.9#Subclause_3.9.1">3.9.1</a> are rechecked), so we have a special rule to prevent that in the private part (type extension from a formal type is illegal in a generic package body). <br /></Admonition>

<p>A specific type <em>T2</em> is defined to be a <em>descendant</em> of a type <em>T1</em> if <em>T2</em> is the same as <em>T1</em>, or if <em>T2</em> is derived (directly or indirectly) from <em>T1</em>. A class-wide type <em>T2</em>'Class is defined to be a descendant of type <em>T1</em> if <em>T2</em> is a descendant of <em>T1</em>. Similarly, the numeric universal types are defined to be descendants of the root types of their classes. If a type <em>T2</em> is a descendant of a type <em>T1</em>, then <em>T1</em> is called an <em>ancestor</em> of <em>T2</em>. An <em>ultimate ancestor</em> of a type is an ancestor of that type that is not itself a descendant of any other type. Every untagged type has a unique ultimate ancestor. <br /></p>

NOTE   Because operands of a universal type are acceptable to the predefined operators of any type in their class, ambiguity can result.
