<strong></strong>A derived type is a type defined in terms of one or more other types given in a derived type definition. The first of those types is the parent type of the derived type and any others are progenitor types. Each class containing the parent type or a progenitor type also contains the derived type. The derived type inherits properties such as components and primitive operations from the parent and progenitors. A type together with the types derived from it (directly or indirectly) form a derivation class.<br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00442-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />A <em>class of types</em> is a set of types that is closed under derivation; that is, if the parent or a progenitor type of a derived type belongs to a class, then so does the derived type. By saying that a particular group of types forms a class, we are saying that all derivatives of a type in the set inherit the characteristics that define that set. The more general term <em>category of types</em> is used for a set of types whose defining characteristics are not necessarily inherited by derivatives; for example, limited, abstract, and interface are all categories of types, but not classes of types.<br /></p>

If the parent type is an untagged limited formal type with an actual type that is nonlimited, we allow derivation as a limited type in the private part or body as no place could have visibility on the resulting type where it was known to be nonlimited (outside of the instance). (See the previous paragraph's annotations for an explanation of this.) However, if the parent type is a tagged limited formal type with an actual type that is nonlimited, it would be possible to pass a value of the limited type extension to a class-wide type of the parent, which would be nonlimited. That's too weird to allow (even though all of the extension components would have to be nonlimited because the rules of <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.9#Subclause_3.9.1">3.9.1</a> are rechecked), so we have a special rule to prevent that in the private part (type extension from a formal type is illegal in a generic package body). <br /></Admonition>

<dd>Universal types are defined for [(and belong to)] the integer, real, fixed point, and access classes, and are referred to in this document as respectively, <em>universal_integer</em>, <em>universal_real</em>, <em>universal_fixed</em>, and <em>universal_access</em>. These are analogous to class-wide types for these language-defined elementary classes. As with class-wide types, if a formal parameter is of a universal type, then an actual parameter of any type in the corresponding class is acceptable. In addition, a value of a universal type (including an integer or real <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.4#S0006">numeric_literal</a></code>, or the literal <strong>null</strong>) is "universal" in that it is acceptable where some particular type in the class is expected (see <a href="../AA-8/AA-8.6">8.6</a>).<br /></dd>

{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00230-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />We considered defining class-wide or perhaps universal types for all derivation classes, not just tagged classes and these four elementary classes. However, this was felt to overly weaken the strong-typing model in some situations. Tagged types preserve strong type distinctions thanks to the run-time tag. Class-wide or universal types for untagged types would weaken the compile-time type distinctions without providing a compensating run-time-checkable distinction.<br /></Admonition>

<strong>To be honest: </strong>Formally, the set of values of a universal type is actually a <em>copy</em> of the undiscriminated union of the values of the types in its class. This is because we want each value to have exactly one type, with explicit or implicit conversion needed to go between types. An alternative, consistent model would be to associate a class, rather than a particular type, with a value, even though any given expression would have a particular type. In that case, implicit type conversions would not generally need to change the value, although an associated subtype conversion might need to. <br /></Admonition>
