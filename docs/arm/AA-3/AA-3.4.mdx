<p>A <em>class of types</em> is a set of types that is closed under derivation; that is, if the parent or a progenitor type of a derived type belongs to a class, then so does the derived type. By saying that a particular group of types forms a class, we are saying that all derivatives of a type in the set inherit the characteristics that define that set. The more general term <em>category of types</em> is used for a set of types whose defining characteristics are not necessarily inherited by derivatives; for example, limited, abstract, and interface are all categories of types, but not classes of types.<br /></p>

If the parent type is an untagged limited formal type with an actual type that is nonlimited, we allow derivation as a limited type in the private part or body as no place could have visibility on the resulting type where it was known to be nonlimited (outside of the instance). (See the previous paragraph's annotations for an explanation of this.) However, if the parent type is a tagged limited formal type with an actual type that is nonlimited, it would be possible to pass a value of the limited type extension to a class-wide type of the parent, which would be nonlimited. That's too weird to allow (even though all of the extension components would have to be nonlimited because the rules of <a href="/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.9#Subclause_3.9.1">3.9.1</a> are rechecked), so we have a special rule to prevent that in the private part (type extension from a formal type is illegal in a generic package body). <br />

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
We considered defining class-wide or perhaps universal types for all derivation classes, not just tagged classes and these four elementary classes. However, this was felt to overly weaken the strong-typing model in some situations. Tagged types preserve strong type distinctions thanks to the run-time tag. Class-wide or universal types for untagged types would weaken the compile-time type distinctions without providing a compensating run-time-checkable distinction.<br />

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>Formally, the set of values of a universal type is actually a <em>copy</em> of the undiscriminated union of the values of the types in its class. This is because we want each value to have exactly one type, with explicit or implicit conversion needed to go between types. An alternative, consistent model would be to associate a class, rather than a particular type, with a value, even though any given expression would have a particular type. In that case, implicit type conversions would not generally need to change the value, although an associated subtype conversion might need to. <br />

<p>A specific type <em>T2</em> is defined to be a <em>descendant</em> of a type <em>T1</em> if <em>T2</em> is the same as <em>T1</em>, or if <em>T2</em> is derived (directly or indirectly) from <em>T1</em>. A class-wide type <em>T2</em>'Class is defined to be a descendant of type <em>T1</em> if <em>T2</em> is a descendant of <em>T1</em>. Similarly, the numeric universal types are defined to be descendants of the root types of their classes. If a type <em>T2</em> is a descendant of a type <em>T1</em>, then <em>T1</em> is called an <em>ancestor</em> of <em>T2</em>. An <em>ultimate ancestor</em> of a type is an ancestor of that type that is not itself a descendant of any other type. Every untagged type has a unique ultimate ancestor. <br /></p>
