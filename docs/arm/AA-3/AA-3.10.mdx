<p>A value of an access type (an <em>access value</em>) provides indirect access to the object or subprogram it <em>designates</em>. Depending on its type, an access value can designate either subprograms, objects created by allocators (see <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8">4.8</a>), or more generally <em>aliased</em> objects of an appropriate type. <br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0012</em>{"}"} There are two kinds of access types, <em>access-to-object</em> types, whose values designate objects, and <em>access-to-subprogram</em> types, whose values designate subprograms. Associated with an access-to-object type is a <em>storage pool</em>; several access types may share the same storage pool. All descendants of an access type share the same storage pool. A storage pool is an area of storage used to hold dynamically allocated objects (called <em>pool elements</em>) created by allocators[; storage pools are described further in <a href="../AA-13/AA-13.11">13.11</a>, &ldquo;<a href="../AA-13/AA-13.11">Storage Management</a>&rdquo;].<br /></p>

<MarginText>8</MarginText>
<p>Access-to-object types are further subdivided into <em>pool-specific</em> access types, whose values can designate only the elements of their associated storage pool, and <em>general</em> access types, whose values can designate the elements of any storage pool, as well as aliased objects created by declarations rather than allocators, and aliased subcomponents of other objects. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note">

In addition, the dereference of an access-to-object value denotes an aliased view, as does a view conversion (see <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6">4.6</a>) of an aliased view. A <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.7#S0163">qualified_expression</a></code> denotes an aliased view when the operand denotes an aliased view. The current instance of an immutably limited type (see <a href="../AA-7/AA-7.5">7.5</a>) is defined to be aliased. Finally, a formal parameter or generic formal object of a tagged type is defined to be aliased. [Aliased views are the ones that can be designated by an access value.] <br /></p>

We considered making more kinds of objects aliased by default. In particular, any object of a by-reference type will pretty much have to be allocated at an addressable location, so it can be passed by reference without using bit-field pointers. Therefore, one might wish to allow the Access and Unchecked_Access attributes for such objects. However, private parts are transparent to the definition of &ldquo;by-reference type&rdquo;, so if we made all objects of a by-reference type aliased, we would be violating the privacy of private parts. Instead, we would have to define a concept of &ldquo;visibly by-reference&rdquo; and base the rule on that. This seemed to complicate the rules more than it was worth, especially since there is no way to declare an untagged limited private type to be by-reference, since the full type might by nonlimited. <br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>For a named access-to-subprogram type, the representation of an access value might include implementation-defined information needed to support up-level references &mdash; for example, a static link. The accessibility rules (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#Subclause_3.10.2">3.10.2</a>) ensure that in a "global-display-based" implementation model (as opposed to a static-link-based model), a named access-to-(unprotected)-subprogram value need consist only of the address of the subprogram. The global display is guaranteed to be properly set up any time the designated subprogram is called. Even in a static-link-based model, the only time a static link is definitely required is for an access-to-subprogram type declared in a scope nested at least two levels deep within subprogram or task bodies, since values of such a type might designate subprograms nested a smaller number of levels.

## 3.10.2  Operations of Access Types

<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>[The attribute Access is used to create access values designating aliased objects and nonintrinsic subprograms. The &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo; rules prevent dangling references (in the absence of uses of certain unchecked features &mdash; see Clause <a href="../AA-13/">13</a>).] <br /></p>


#### Language Design Principles

<MarginText>1.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
It should be possible for an access value to designate an object declared by an object declaration, or a subcomponent thereof. In implementation terms, this means pointing at stack-allocated and statically allocated data structures. However, dangling references should be prevented, primarily via compile-time rules, so long as features like Unchecked_Access and Unchecked_Deallocation are not used.<br /></Admonition>

#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>3/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00162-01", "AI12-0406-1"]} />
<p>[The accessibility rules, which prevent dangling references, are written in terms of <em>accessibility levels</em>, which reflect the run-time nesting of <em>masters</em>. As explained in <a href="../AA-7/AA-7.6#Subclause_7.6.1">7.6.1</a>, a master is the execution of a certain construct (called a <em>master construct</em>), such as a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.3#S0216">subprogram_body</a></code>. An accessibility level is <em>deeper than</em> another if it is more deeply nested at run time. For example, an object declared local to a called subprogram has a deeper accessibility level than an object declared local to the calling subprogram. The accessibility rules for access types require that the accessibility level of an object designated by an access value be no deeper than that of the access type. This ensures that the object will live at least as long as the access type, which in turn ensures that the access value cannot later designate an object that no longer exists. The Unchecked_Access attribute may be used to circumvent the accessibility rules.]<br /></p>

A more efficient method is based on passing <em>static</em> nesting levels (within constructs that correspond at run time to masters &mdash; packages don't count). Whenever an access parameter is passed, an implicit extra parameter is passed with it. The extra parameter represents (in an indirect way) the accessibility level of the anonymous access type, and, therefore, the level of the view denoted by a dereference of the access parameter. This is analogous to the implicit &ldquo;Constrained&rdquo; bit associated with certain formal parameters of an unconstrained but definite composite subtype. In this method, we avoid distributed overhead: it is not necessary to pass any extra information to subprograms that have no access parameters. For anything other than an access parameter and its anonymous type, the static nesting level is known at compile time, and is defined analogously to the RM95 definition of accessibility level (e.g. derived access types get their nesting level from their parent).

However, code that could tell this difference is fairly rare (taking 'Access of a component of a result of a type conversion), code depending on this accessibility was not portable, and such code could have created an immediately dangling pointer if the conversion actually made a copy (which is necessary in some instances).<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The accessibility of a renaming of a formal subprogram in a generic package specification has changed to reflect the fact that a wrapper may be needed for the formal subprogram. Thus, 'Access of such a renaming found in an instance that is not library-level may become illegal. We think this case is unlikely to occur in practice, and a simple workaround is available (rename the actual at the point of the instance, use that rename as the prefix of 'Access). <br /></Admonition>

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0402-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Adjusted the special accessibility for functions initializing objects to only apply to composite types. This makes some function calls of functions that return elementary types and have aliased parameters legal that otherwise would be illegal. Such a function cannot return a part of a parameter, and thus one does not need parameter checks to make that possible. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0372-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction">
<strong></strong> Redefined the statically deeper relationship for the master of a function call and locals of that call. This might cause programs to be rejected that were previously legal, but any such program should have failed a dynamic accessibility check. Thus this is not an incompatibility as it is changing the detection of an error from runtime to compile-time.<br /></Admonition>
