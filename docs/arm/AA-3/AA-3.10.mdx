<p>A value of an access type (an <em>access value</em>) provides indirect access to the object or subprogram it <em>designates</em>. Depending on its type, an access value can designate either subprograms, objects created by allocators (see <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.8">4.8</a>), or more generally <em>aliased</em> objects of an appropriate type. <br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0012</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00062-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />There are two kinds of access types, <em>access-to-object</em> types, whose values designate objects, and <em>access-to-subprogram</em> types, whose values designate subprograms. Associated with an access-to-object type is a <em>storage pool</em>; several access types may share the same storage pool. All descendants of an access type share the same storage pool. A storage pool is an area of storage used to hold dynamically allocated objects (called <em>pool elements</em>) created by allocators[; storage pools are described further in <a href="../AA-13/AA-13.11">13.11</a>, "<a href="../AA-13/AA-13.11">Storage Management</a>"].<br /></p>

We considered making more kinds of objects aliased by default. In particular, any object of a by-reference type will pretty much have to be allocated at an addressable location, so it can be passed by reference without using bit-field pointers. Therefore, one might wish to allow the Access and Unchecked_Access attributes for such objects. However, private parts are transparent to the definition of "by-reference type", so if we made all objects of a by-reference type aliased, we would be violating the privacy of private parts. Instead, we would have to define a concept of "visibly by-reference" and base the rule on that. This seemed to complicate the rules more than it was worth, especially since there is no way to declare an untagged limited private type to be by-reference, since the full type might by nonlimited. <br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00254-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />For a named access-to-subprogram type, the representation of an access value might include implementation-defined information needed to support up-level references - for example, a static link. The accessibility rules (see <a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#Subclause_3.10.2">3.10.2</a>) ensure that in a "global-display-based" implementation model (as opposed to a static-link-based model), a named access-to-(unprotected)-subprogram value need consist only of the address of the subprogram. The global display is guaranteed to be properly set up any time the designated subprogram is called. Even in a static-link-based model, the only time a static link is definitely required is for an access-to-subprogram type declared in a scope nested at least two levels deep within subprogram or task bodies, since values of such a type might designate subprograms nested a smaller number of levels. For the normal case of a named access-to-subprogram type declared at the outermost (library) level, a code address by itself should be sufficient to represent the access value in many implementations.<br /></Admonition>

For access-to-protected-subprogram, the access values will necessarily include both an address (or other identification) of the code of the subprogram, as well as the address of the associated protected object. This could be thought of as a static link, but it will be needed even for global-display-based implementation models.

Any Elaboration_Check is performed when a call is made through an access value, rather than when the access value is first "created" via a 'Access. For implementation models that normally put that check at the call-site, an access value will have to point to a separate entry point that does the check. Alternatively, the access value could point to a "subprogram descriptor" that consisted of two words (or perhaps more), the first being the address of the code, the second being the elaboration bit. Or perhaps more efficiently, just the address of the code, but using the trick that the descriptor is initialized to point to a Raise-Program-Error routine initially, and then set to point to the "real" code when the body is elaborated.<br /></Admonition>

For implementations that share code between generic instantiations, the extra level of indirection suggested above to support Elaboration_Checks could also be used to provide a pointer to the per-instance data area normally required when calling shared code.

Because of the definition of "excludes null" given in this subclause, an access parameter that designates an untagged private type P (which does not exclude null) does not match its completion if P is completed with a tagged type (in that case, the parameter is controlling and thus excludes null, regardless of whether there is an explicit null exclusion on the body).

<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0402-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />We restrict the above rule to apply only if the function result is declared to be of a composite type. This makes sense since only results of a composite type (or of an anonymous access type, which are handled separately below) are potentially affected by the master of the function call. Note that a private type is considered composite, so this result assumes the worst for a function returning a private type. We could have made the rule more complex, depending on whether the result might be built in place, or might have an access discriminant, but we chose to keep the rule simpler. The wording says "the result type at the point of function declaration is a composite type", to make it clear that this depends on the properties at the point of the declaration of the function, rather than properties that might be known at the point of call or inside the function body. <br /></Admonition>

Accessibility is not enforced at compile time for access parameters of an access-to-object type.

The "obvious" implementation would be to pass the level of the caller at each subprogram call, task creation, etc. This level would be incremented by 1 for each dynamically nested master.

A more efficient method is based on passing <em>static</em> nesting levels (within constructs that correspond at run time to masters - packages don't count). Whenever an access parameter is passed, an implicit extra parameter is passed with it. The extra parameter represents (in an indirect way) the accessibility level of the anonymous access type, and, therefore, the level of the view denoted by a dereference of the access parameter. This is analogous to the implicit "Constrained" bit associated with certain formal parameters of an unconstrained but definite composite subtype. In this method, we avoid distributed overhead: it is not necessary to pass any extra information to subprograms that have no access parameters. For anything other than an access parameter and its anonymous type, the static nesting level is known at compile time, and is defined analogously to the RM95 definition of accessibility level (e.g. derived access types get their nesting level from their parent). Checking "not deeper than" is a "{"<"}=" test on the levels.<br /></Admonition>
