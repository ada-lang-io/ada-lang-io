An implementation should not provide extensions that conflict with those defined in the Specialized Needs Annexes, in the following sense: Suppose an implementation supports a certain error-free program that uses only functionality defined in the core and in the Specialized Needs Annexes. The implementation should ensure that that program will still be error free in some possible full implementation of all of the Specialized Needs Annexes, and that the semantics of the program will not change. For example, an implementation should not provide a package with the same name as one defined in one of the Specialized Needs Annexes, but that behaves differently, <i>even if that implementation does not claim conformance to that Annex</i>.<br />

#### Language Design Principles

These are not rules of the language, but guiding principles or goals used in defining the rules of the language. In some cases, the goal is only partially met; such cases are explained.<br />

#### Syntax

<MarginText>25_1.1.2</MarginText>
<p class="Indented2">Syntax rules (indented). <br /></p>


#### Name Resolution Rules

<MarginText>26/3_1.1.2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0299-1"]} />
<p>Compile-time rules that are used in name resolution, including overload resolution. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>26.a_1.1.2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<b></b>These rules are observed at compile time. (We say &ldquo;observed&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;checked&rdquo;, because these rules are not individually checked. They are really just part of the Legality Rules in Clause <a href="/docs/arm/AA-8/">8</a> that require exactly one interpretation of each constituent of a complete context.) The only rules used in overload resolution are the Syntax Rules and the Name Resolution Rules.<br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>26.b_1.1.2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
When dealing with nonoverloadable declarations it sometimes makes no semantic difference whether a given rule is a Name Resolution Rule or a Legality Rule, and it is sometimes difficult to decide which it should be. We generally make a given rule a Name Resolution Rule only if it has to be. For example, &ldquo;The <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>, if any, in a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-11/AA-11.3#S0308">raise_statement</a></code> shall be the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> of an exception.&rdquo; is under &ldquo;Legality Rules.&rdquo; <br />

#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>28_1.1.2</MarginText>
<p>A definition of the compile-time effect of each construct. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>28.a_1.1.2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<b></b>The most important compile-time effects represent the effects on the symbol table associated with declarations (implicit or explicit). In addition, we use this heading as a bit of a grab bag for equivalences, package specifications, etc. For example, this is where we put statements like so-and-so is equivalent to such-and-such. (We ought to try to really mean it when we say such things!) Similarly, statements about magically-generated implicit declarations go here. These rules are generally written as statements of fact about the semantics, rather than as a you-shall-do-such-and-such sort of thing. <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>


#### Post-Compilation Rules

<MarginText>29_1.1.2</MarginText>
<p>Rules that are enforced before running a partition. A partition is legal if its compilation units are legal and it obeys all of the Post-Compilation Rules. <br /></p>

<b></b>It is not specified exactly when these rules are checked, so long as they are checked for any given partition before that partition starts running. An implementation may choose to check some such rules at compile time, and reject <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-10/AA-10.1#S0286">compilation_unit</a></code>s accordingly. Alternatively, an implementation may check such rules when the partition is created (usually known as &ldquo;link time&rdquo;), or when the partition is mapped to a particular piece of hardware (but before the partition starts running). <br />

#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>30_1.1.2</MarginText>
<p>A definition of the run-time effect of each construct. <br /></p>

<MarginText>30.a_1.1.2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<b></b>This heading describes what happens at run time. runtime checks, which raise exceptions upon failure, are described here. Each item that involves a runtime check is marked with the name of the check &mdash; these are the same check names that are used in a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> Suppress. Principle: Every check should have a name, usable in a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> Suppress. <br />

#### Bounded (Run-Time) Errors

<MarginText>31_1.1.2</MarginText>

#### Erroneous Execution

<MarginText>32_1.1.2</MarginText>
<p>Situations that result in erroneous execution (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-1/AA-1.1#Subclause_1.1.5">1.1.5</a>). <br /></p>

<MarginText>34.a_1.1.2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<b></b>These requirements are beyond those that are implicitly specified by the phrase &ldquo;implementation defined&rdquo;.

#### Metrics

<MarginText>35_1.1.2</MarginText>
<p>Metrics that are specified for the time/space properties of the execution of certain language constructs. <br /></p>


#### Implementation Permissions

<MarginText>36_1.1.2</MarginText>
<p>Additional permissions given to the implementer. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>36.a_1.1.2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<b></b>For example, &ldquo;The implementation is allowed to impose further restrictions on the record aggregates allowed in code statements.&rdquo; When there are restrictions on the permission, those restrictions are given here also. For example, &ldquo;An implementation is allowed to restrict the kinds of subprograms that are allowed to be main subprograms. However, it shall support at least parameterless procedures.&rdquo; &mdash; we don't split this up between here and &ldquo;Implementation Requirements&rdquo;. <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>


#### Implementation Advice

<MarginText>37_1.1.2</MarginText>
<p>Optional advice given to the implementer. The word &ldquo;should&rdquo; is used to indicate that the advice is a recommendation, not a requirement. It is implementation defined whether or not a given recommendation is obeyed. <br /></p>

Note that the Ada 83 RM explicitly mentions the case of an &ldquo;exact effect&rdquo; of a program, but since so few programs have their effects defined that exactly, we don't even mention this &ldquo;special&rdquo; case. In particular, almost any program that uses floating point or tasking has to have some level of inexactness in the specification of its effects. And if one includes aspects of the timing of the external interactions in the external effect of the program (as is appropriate for a real-time language), no &ldquo;exact effect&rdquo; can be specified. For example, if two external interactions initiated by a single task are separated by a &ldquo;<b>delay</b> 1.0;&rdquo; then the language rules imply that the two external interactions have to be separated in time by at least one second, as defined by the clock associated with the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.6#S0268">delay_relative_statement</a></code>.

A restricted implementation might be restricted by not providing some subprograms specified in one of the packages defined by an Annex.

Alternatively, a subprogram body might be implemented just to raise Program{"_"}Error. The advantage of this approach is that a program to be run under a fully conforming Annex implementation can be checked syntactically and semantically under an implementation that only partially supports the Annex.

#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>1_1.1.5</MarginText>
<p>The language definition classifies errors into several different categories: <br /></p>

<MarginText>2_1.1.5</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>Errors that are required to be detected prior to run time by every Ada implementation;<br /></li>
<MarginText>3_1.1.5</MarginText>
<li>These errors correspond to any violation of a rule given in this document, other than those listed below. In particular, violation of any rule that uses the terms shall, allowed, permitted, legal, or illegal belongs to this category. Any program that contains such an error is not a legal Ada program; on the other hand, the fact that a program is legal does not mean, <i>per se</i>, that the program is free from other forms of error.<br /></li>
<MarginText>4_1.1.5</MarginText>
<li>The rules are further classified as either compile time rules, or post compilation rules, depending on whether a violation has to be detected at the time a compilation unit is submitted to the compiler, or may be postponed until the time a compilation unit is incorporated into a partition of a program. <br /></li>
</ul>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.a_1.1.5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<b></b>See, for example, <a href="/docs/arm/AA-10/AA-10.1#Subclause_10.1.3">10.1.3</a>, &ldquo;<a href="/docs/arm/AA-10/AA-10.1#Subclause_10.1.3">Subunits of Compilation Units</a>&rdquo;, for some errors that are detected only after compilation. Implementations are allowed, but not required, to detect post compilation rules at compile time when possible. <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>5_1.1.5</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>Errors that are required to be detected at run time by the execution of an Ada program;<br /></li>
<MarginText>6_1.1.5</MarginText>
<li>The corresponding error situations are associated with the names of the predefined exceptions. Every Ada compiler is required to generate code that raises the corresponding exception if such an error situation arises during program execution. [If such an error situation is certain to arise in every execution of a construct, then an implementation is allowed (although not required) to report this fact at compilation time.]<br /></li>
<MarginText>7_1.1.5</MarginText>
<li>Bounded errors;<br /></li>
<MarginText>8/5_1.1.5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0444-1"]} />
<li>The language rules define certain kinds of errors that are not expected to be detected either prior to or during run time, but if not detected, the range of possible effects shall be bounded. The errors of this category are called <i>bounded errors</i>. The possible effects of a given bounded error are specified for each such error, but in any case one possible effect of a bounded error is the raising of the exception Program{"_"}Error. <br /></li>
<MarginText>9_1.1.5</MarginText>
<li>Erroneous execution.<br /></li>
<MarginText>10/5_1.1.5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0444-1"]} />
<li>In addition to bounded errors, the language rules define certain kinds of errors as leading to <i>erroneous execution</i>. Like bounded errors, the implementation is not expected to detect such errors either prior to or during run time. Unlike bounded errors, there is no language-specified bound on the possible effect of erroneous execution; the effect is in general not predictable. <br /></li>

#### Implementation Permissions

<MarginText>11_1.1.5</MarginText>
<p>[ An implementation may provide <i>nonstandard modes</i> of operation. Typically these modes would be selected by a <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> or by a command line switch when the compiler is invoked. When operating in a nonstandard mode, the implementation may reject <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-10/AA-10.1#S0286">compilation_unit</a></code>s that do not conform to additional requirements associated with the mode, such as an excessive number of warnings or violation of coding style guidelines. Similarly, in a nonstandard mode, the implementation may apply special optimizations or alternative algorithms that are only meaningful for programs that satisfy certain criteria specified by the implementation. In any case, an implementation shall support a <i>standard</i> mode that conforms to the requirements of this Reference Manual; in particular, in the standard mode, all legal <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-10/AA-10.1#S0286">compilation_unit</a></code>s shall be accepted.] <br /></p>

<MarginText>12.b_1.1.5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Other situations that are erroneous in Ada 83 are changed to be bounded errors. In particular, evaluating an uninitialized scalar variable is a bounded error. The possible results are to raise Program{"_"}Error (as always), or to produce a machine-representable value (which might not be in the subtype of the variable). Violating a Range{"_"}Check or Overflow{"_"}Check raises Constraint{"_"}Error, even if the value came from an uninitialized variable. This means that optimizers can no longer &ldquo;assume&rdquo; that all variables are initialized within their subtype's range. Violating a check that is suppressed remains erroneous.<br />

<MarginText>12.c_1.1.5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The &ldquo;incorrect order dependences&rdquo; category of errors is removed. All such situations are simply considered potential nonportabilities. This category was removed due to the difficulty of defining what it means for two executions to have a &ldquo;different effect&rdquo;. For example, if a function with a side effect is called twice in a single expression, it is not in principle possible for the compiler to decide whether the correctness of the resulting program depends on the order of execution of the two function calls. A compile time warning might be appropriate, but raising of Program{"_"}Error at run time would not be. <br />
