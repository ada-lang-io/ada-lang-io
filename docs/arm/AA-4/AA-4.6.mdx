<p>[Explicit type conversions, both value conversions and view conversions, are allowed between closely related types as defined below. This subclause also defines rules for value and view conversions to a particular subtype of a type, both explicit ones and those implicit in other constructs. ]<br /></p>

</CodeBlock>
<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>The <em>target subtype</em> of a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> is the subtype denoted by the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0028">subtype_mark</a></code>. The <em>operand</em> of a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> is the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> within the parentheses; its type is the <em>operand type</em>.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0299-1"]} />
<p>One type is <em>convertible</em> to a second type if a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> with the first type as operand type and the second type as target type is legal according to the rules of this subclause. Two types are convertible if each is convertible to the other. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<strong></strong>Note that &ldquo;convertible&rdquo; is defined in terms of legality of the conversion. Whether the conversion would raise an exception at run time is irrelevant to this definition. <br /></Admonition>

#### Name Resolution Rules

<p>The operand of a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> is expected to be of any type. <br /></p>

</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>7</MarginText>

#### Legality Rules

<MarginText>8/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00251-01"]} />
<p>In a view conversion for an untagged type, the target type shall be convertible (back) to the operand type. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>Untagged view conversions appear only as [<strong>in</strong>] <strong>out</strong> parameters. Hence, the reverse conversion must be legal as well.

Much of the wording of the legality section is unchanged, but it is reordered and reformatted. Because of the limitations of our tools, we had to delete and replace nearly the entire section. The text of Ada 95 paragraphs 8 through 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, and 24 are unchanged (just moved); these are now 24.1 through 24.5, 24.12, 24.13, 24.17, 24.19, 24.20, and 8. <br /></Admonition>

<p>For the evaluation of a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> that is a value conversion, the operand is evaluated, and then the value of the operand is <em>converted</em> to a <em>corresponding</em> value of the target type, if any. If there is no value of the target type that corresponds to the operand value, Constraint_Error is raised[; this can only happen on conversion to a modular type, and only when the operand value is outside the base range of the modular type.] Additional rules follow: <br /></p>

<strong></strong>This was implementation defined in Ada 83. There seems no reason to preserve the nonportability in Ada 95. Round-away-from-zero is the conventional definition of rounding, and standard Fortran and COBOL both specify rounding away from zero, so for interoperability, it seems important to pick this. This is also the most easily &ldquo;undone&rdquo; by hand. Round-to-nearest-even is an alternative, but that is quite complicated if not supported by the hardware. In any case, this operation is not usually part of an inner loop, so predictability and portability are judged most important. A floating point attribute function Unbiased_Rounding is provided (see <a href="../AA-A/AA-A.5#Subclause_A.5.3">A.5.3</a>) for those applications that require round-to-nearest-even, and a floating point attribute function Machine_Rounding (also see <a href="../AA-A/AA-A.5#Subclause_A.5.3">A.5.3</a>) is provided for those applications that require the highest possible performance. &ldquo;Deterministic&rdquo; rounding is required for static conversions to integer as well.

&ldquo;Sliding&rdquo; of array bounds (which is part of conversion to an array subtype) is performed in more cases in Ada 95 than in Ada 83.

It wouldn't make sense on a membership test, and we wish to retain a connection between subtype membership and subtype qualification. In general, a subtype membership test returns True if and only if a corresponding subtype qualification succeeds without raising an exception.

<strong></strong> Predicate checks are no longer made on any <strong>out</strong> parameters before a call (they're still made when the call returns). This was already true for elementary <strong>out</strong> parameters.

Similarly, predicate checks are no longer made on the view conversion of a target of an <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.2#S0173">assignment_statement</a></code>.
