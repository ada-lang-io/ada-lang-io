<p>[Explicit type conversions, both value conversions and view conversions, are allowed between closely related types as defined below. This subclause also defines rules for value and view conversions to a particular subtype of a type, both explicit ones and those implicit in other constructs. ]<br /></p>

</CodeBlock>
<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>The <em>target subtype</em> of a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> is the subtype denoted by the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0028">subtype_mark</a></code>. The <em>operand</em> of a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> is the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> within the parentheses; its type is the <em>operand type</em>.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0299-1"]} />
<p>One type is <em>convertible</em> to a second type if a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> with the first type as operand type and the second type as target type is legal according to the rules of this subclause. Two types are convertible if each is convertible to the other. <br /></p>

<MarginText>4.a</MarginText>

#### Legality Rules

<MarginText>8/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00251-01"]} />
<p>In a view conversion for an untagged type, the target type shall be convertible (back) to the operand type. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>Untagged view conversions appear only as [<strong>in</strong>] <strong>out</strong> parameters. Hence, the reverse conversion must be legal as well.

Much of the wording of the legality section is unchanged, but it is reordered and reformatted. Because of the limitations of our tools, we had to delete and replace nearly the entire section. The text of Ada 95 paragraphs 8 through 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, and 24 are unchanged (just moved); these are now 24.1 through 24.5, 24.12, 24.13, 24.17, 24.19, 24.20, and 8. <br />

<p>For the evaluation of a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> that is a value conversion, the operand is evaluated, and then the value of the operand is <em>converted</em> to a <em>corresponding</em> value of the target type, if any. If there is no value of the target type that corresponds to the operand value, Constraint{"_"}Error is raised[; this can only happen on conversion to a modular type, and only when the operand value is outside the base range of the modular type.] Additional rules follow: <br /></p>

<strong></strong>This was implementation defined in Ada 83. There seems no reason to preserve the nonportability in Ada 95. Round-away-from-zero is the conventional definition of rounding, and standard Fortran and COBOL both specify rounding away from zero, so for interoperability, it seems important to pick this. This is also the most easily &ldquo;undone&rdquo; by hand. Round-to-nearest-even is an alternative, but that is quite complicated if not supported by the hardware. In any case, this operation is not usually part of an inner loop, so predictability and portability are judged most important. A floating point attribute function Unbiased{"_"}Rounding is provided (see <a href="../AA-A/AA-A.5#Subclause_A.5.3">A.5.3</a>) for those applications that require round-to-nearest-even, and a floating point attribute function Machine{"_"}Rounding (also see <a href="../AA-A/AA-A.5#Subclause_A.5.3">A.5.3</a>) is provided for those applications that require the highest possible performance. &ldquo;Deterministic&rdquo; rounding is required for static conversions to integer as well.
