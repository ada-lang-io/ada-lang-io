<p>[This subclause specifies requirements on the immediacy with which an aborted construct is completed.] <br /></p>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>On a system with a single processor, an aborted construct is completed immediately at the first point that is outside the execution of an abort-deferred operation.<br /></p>


#### Documentation Requirements

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>On a multiprocessor, the implementation shall document any conditions that cause the completion of an aborted construct to be delayed later than what is specified for a single processor. <br /></p>

<b>Documentation Requirement: </b>On a multiprocessor, any conditions that cause the completion of an aborted construct to be delayed later than what is specified for a single processor.<br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>


#### Metrics

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>The implementation shall document the following metrics: <br /></p>

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>The execution time, in processor clock cycles, that it takes for an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.8#S0284">abort_statement</a></code> to cause the completion of the aborted task. This is measured in a situation where a task T2 preempts task T1 and aborts T1. T1 does not have any finalization code. T2 shall verify that T1 has terminated, by means of the Terminated attribute.<br /></li>
<MarginText>6</MarginText>
<li>On a multiprocessor, an upper bound in seconds, on the time that the completion of an aborted task can be delayed beyond the point that it is required for a single processor.<br /></li>
<MarginText>7/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00114-01"]} />
<li>An upper bound on the execution time of an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code>, in processor clock cycles. This is measured between a point immediately before a task T1 executes a protected operation Pr.Set that makes the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-4/AA-4.5#S0150">condition</a></code> of an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.5#S0262">entry_barrier</a></code> Pr.Wait True, and the point where task T2 resumes execution immediately after an entry call to Pr.Wait in an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code>. T1 preempts T2 while T2 is executing the abortable part, and then blocks itself so that T2 can execute. The execution time of T1 is measured separately, and subtracted.<br /></li>
<MarginText>8</MarginText>
<li>An upper bound on the execution time of an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code>, in the case that no asynchronous transfer of control takes place. This is measured between a point immediately before a task executes the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code> with a nonnull abortable part, and the point where the task continues execution immediately after it. The execution time of the abortable part is subtracted. <br /></li>
</ul>

#### Implementation Advice

<MarginText>9</MarginText>
<p>Even though the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.8#S0284">abort_statement</a></code> is included in the list of potentially blocking operations (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.5#Subclause_9.5.1">9.5.1</a>), it is recommended that this statement be implemented in a way that never requires the task executing the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.8#S0284">abort_statement</a></code> to block.<br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>9.a/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-advice">
<b></b>The <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.8#S0284">abort_statement</a></code> should not require the task executing the statement to block.<br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>10</MarginText>
<p>On a multi-processor, the delay associated with aborting a task on another processor should be bounded; the implementation should use periodic polling, if necessary, to achieve this.<br /></p>
