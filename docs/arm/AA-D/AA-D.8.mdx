<p>In this Annex, <em>real time</em> is defined to be the physical time as observed in the external environment. The type Time is a <em>time type</em> as defined by <a href="../AA-9/AA-9.6">9.6</a>; [values of this type may be used in a <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.6#S0267">delay_until_statement</a></code>.] Values of this type represent segments of an ideal time line. The set of values of the type Time corresponds one-to-one with an implementation-defined range of mathematical integers. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>18.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<strong></strong>Informally, real time is defined to be the International Atomic Time (TAI) which is monotonic and nondecreasing. We use it here for the purpose of discussing rate of change and monotonic behavior only. It does not imply anything about the absolute value of Real_Time.Clock, or about Real_Time.Time being synchronized with TAI. It is also used for real time in the metrics, for comparison purposes. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>18.b</MarginText>

<strong></strong>The specification of TAI as &ldquo;real time&rdquo; does not preclude the use of a simulated TAI clock for simulated execution environments. <br /></Admonition>

<p>The Time value I represents the half-open real time interval that starts with E+I*Time_Unit and is limited by E+(I+1)*Time_Unit, where Time_Unit is an implementation-defined real number and E is an unspecified origin point, the <em>epoch</em>, that is the same for all values of the type Time. It is not specified by the language whether the time values are synchronized with any standard time reference. [For example, E can correspond to the time of system initialization or it can correspond to the epoch of some time standard.] <br /></p>

<p>Values of the type Time_Span represent length of real time duration. The set of values of this type corresponds one-to-one with an implementation-defined range of mathematical integers. The Time_Span value corresponding to the integer I represents the real-time duration I*Time_Unit. <br /></p>

<p>Time_First and Time_Last are the smallest and largest values of the Time type, respectively. Similarly, Time_Span_First and Time_Span_Last are the smallest and largest values of the Time_Span type, respectively.<br /></p>

<MarginText>22</MarginText>
<p>A value of type Seconds_Count represents an elapsed time, measured in seconds, since the epoch.<br /></p>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>23</MarginText>
<p>Time_Unit is the smallest amount of real time representable by the Time type; it is expressed in seconds. Time_Span_Unit is the difference between two successive values of the Time type. It is also the smallest positive value of type Time_Span. Time_Unit and Time_Span_Unit represent the same real time duration. A <em>clock tick</em> is a real time interval during which the clock value (as observed by calling the Clock function) remains constant. Tick is the average length of such intervals.<br /></p>

<MarginText>24/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00432-01"]} />
<p>The function To_Duration converts the value TS to a value of type Duration. Similarly, the function To_Time_Span converts the value D to a value of type Time_Span. For To_Duration, the result is rounded to the nearest value of type Duration (away from zero if exactly halfway between two values). If the result is outside the range of Duration, Constraint_Error is raised. For To_Time_Span, the value of D is first rounded to the nearest integral multiple of Time_Unit, away from zero if exactly halfway between two multiples. If the rounded value is outside the range of Time_Span, Constraint_Error is raised. Otherwise, the value is converted to the type Time_Span.<br /></p>

<MarginText>25</MarginText>
<p>To_Duration(Time_Span_Zero) returns 0.0, and To_Time_Span(0.0) returns Time_Span_Zero.<br /></p>

<MarginText>26/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00386-01", "AI95-00432-01"]} />
<p>The functions Nanoseconds, Microseconds, Milliseconds, Seconds, and Minutes convert the input parameter to a value of the type Time_Span. NS, US, MS, S, and M are interpreted as a number of nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, and minutes respectively. The input parameter is first converted to seconds and rounded to the nearest integral multiple of Time_Unit, away from zero if exactly halfway between two multiples. If the rounded value is outside the range of Time_Span, Constraint_Error is raised. Otherwise, the rounded value is converted to the type Time_Span. <br /></p>

<p>The function Clock returns the amount of time since the epoch.<br /></p>

<MarginText>29</MarginText>
<p>The effects of the Split and Time_Of operations are defined as follows, treating values of type Time, Time_Span, and Seconds_Count as mathematical integers. The effect of Split(T,SC,TS) is to set SC and TS to values such that T*Time_Unit = SC*1.0 + TS*Time_Unit, and 0.0 {"<"}= TS*Time_Unit {"<"} 1.0. The value returned by Time_Of(SC,TS) is the value T such that T*Time_Unit = SC*1.0 + TS*Time_Unit. <br /></p>


#### Implementation Requirements

#### Metrics

<MarginText>37/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0299-1"]} />
<p>For the purpose of the metrics defined in this subclause, real time is defined to be the International Atomic Time (TAI).<br /></p>

<MarginText>38</MarginText>
<p>The implementation shall document the following metrics: <br /></p>

<MarginText>39</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>An upper bound on the real-time duration of a clock tick. This is a value D such that if t1 and t2 are any real times such that t1 {"<"} t2 and Clockt1 = Clockt2 then t2 &ndash; t1 {"<"}= D.<br /></li>
<MarginText>40</MarginText>
<li>An upper bound on the size of a clock jump.<br /></li>
<MarginText>41</MarginText>
<li>An upper bound on the <em>drift rate</em> of Clock with respect to real time. This is a real number D such that <br /></li>
</ul>
<MarginText>42</MarginText>
<p class="Indented4">E*(1&ndash;D) {"<"}= (Clockt+E &ndash; Clockt) {"<"}= E*(1+D)<br />        provided that: Clockt + E*(1+D) {"<"}= Time_Last.<br /></p>

<MarginText>43</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>where Clockt is the value of Clock at time t, and E is a real time duration not less than 24 hours. The value of E used for this metric shall be reported. <br /></li>
</ul>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>43.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<strong></strong>This metric is intended to provide a measurement of the long term (cumulative) deviation; therefore, 24 hours is the lower bound on the measurement period. On some implementations, this is also the maximum period, since the language does not require that the range of the type Duration be more than 24 hours. On those implementations that support longer-range Duration, longer measurements should be performed. <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>44</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>An upper bound on the execution time of a call to the Clock function, in processor clock cycles.<br /></li>

<li>Upper bounds on the execution times of the operators of the types Time and Time_Span, in processor clock cycles. <br /></li>
</ul>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>45.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note">
<strong></strong>A fast implementation of the Clock function involves repeated reading until you get the same value twice. It is highly improbable that more than three reads will be necessary. Arithmetic on time values should not be significantly slower than 64-bit arithmetic in the underlying machine instruction set. <br /></Admonition>
