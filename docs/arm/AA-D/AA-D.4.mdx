<p>Three  queuing policies, FIFO_Queuing, Ordered_FIFO_Queuing, and Priority_Queuing, are language defined. If no Queuing_Policy pragma applies to any of the program units comprising the partition, the queuing policy for that partition is FIFO_Queuing. The rules for the FIFO_Queuing  policy are specified in <a href="../AA-9/AA-9.5#Subclause_9.5.3">9.5.3</a> and <a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#Subclause_9.7.1">9.7.1</a>.<br /></p>

<MarginText>7.1/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0163-1"]} />
<p>The Ordered_FIFO_Queuing policy is defined as follows:<br /></p>

<MarginText>7.2/5</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>Calls are selected on a given entry queue in order of arrival.<br /></li>
<MarginText>7.3/5</MarginText>
<li>When more than one condition of an <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.5#S0262">entry_barrier</a></code> of a protected object becomes True, and more than one of the respective queues is nonempty, the call that arrived first is selected.<br /></li>
<MarginText>7.4/5</MarginText>
<li>If the expiration time of two or more open <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0274">delay_alternative</a></code>s is the same and no other <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0273">accept_alternative</a></code>s are open, the <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.1#S0166">sequence_of_statements</a></code> of the <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0274">delay_alternative</a></code> that is first in textual order in the <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0270">selective_accept</a></code> is executed.<br /></li>

</ul>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>7.a/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note">
<strong></strong>A possible implementation for this policy would be to assign a sequence number to each queued entry call, where the sequence number is incremented globally across all queues associated with the protected object or <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0270">selective_accept</a></code>. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>7.b/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<strong></strong>It would have been marginally easier to use textual order for the case when multiple queues are selectable. But textual order can lead to unfair queue servicing, since the queues in earlier textual order will end up starving the later ones if calls arrive fast enough. Applying arrival first as the selector provides fairness for this policy. <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>8</MarginText>
<p>The Priority_Queuing policy is defined as follows:<br /></p>

<MarginText>9</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>The calls to an entry [(including a member of an entry family)] are queued in an order consistent with the priorities of the calls. The <em>priority of an entry call</em> is initialized from the active priority of the calling task at the time the call is made, but can change later. Within the same priority, the order is consistent with the calling (or requeuing, or priority setting) time (that is, a FIFO order).<br /></li>
<MarginText>10/1</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00205-01"]} />
<li>{"{"}<em>8652/0075</em>{"}"} After a call is first queued, changes to the active priority of a task do not affect the priority of the call, unless the base priority of the task is set while the task is blocked on an entry call.<br /></li>
<MarginText>11</MarginText>
<li>When the base priority of a task is set (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.5">D.5</a>), if the task is blocked on an entry call, and the call is queued, the priority of the call is updated to the new active priority of the calling task. This causes the call to be removed from and then reinserted in the queue at the new active priority. <br /></li>
</ul>
<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>11.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<strong></strong>A task is blocked on an entry call if the entry call is simple, conditional, or timed. If the call came from the <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0282">triggering_statement</a></code> of an <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code>, or a requeue thereof, then the task is not blocked on that call; such calls do not have their priority updated. Thus, there can exist many queued calls from a given task (caused by many nested ATC's), but a task can be blocked on only one call at a time.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>11.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
A previous version of Ada 9X required queue reordering in the <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code> case as well. If the call corresponds to a &ldquo;synchronous&rdquo; entry call, then the task is blocked while queued, and it makes good sense to move it up in the queue if its priority is raised.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>11.c</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
However, if the entry call is &ldquo;asynchronous&rdquo;, that is, it is due to an <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code> whose <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0282">triggering_statement</a></code> is an entry call, then the task is not waiting for this entry call, so the placement of the entry call on the queue is irrelevant to the rate at which the task proceeds.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>11.d</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Furthermore, when an entry is used for <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code>s, it is almost certain to be a &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; entry or have only one caller at a time. For example, if the entry is used to notify tasks of a mode switch, then all tasks on the entry queue would be signaled when the mode changes. Similarly, if it is indicating some interrupting event such as a control-C, all tasks sensitive to the interrupt will want to be informed that the event occurred. Hence, the order on such a queue is essentially irrelevant.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>11.e</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Given the above, it seems an unnecessary semantic and implementation complexity to specify that asynchronous queued calls are moved in response to dynamic priority changes. Furthermore, it is somewhat inconsistent, since the call was originally queued based on the active priority of the task, but dynamic priority changes are changing the base priority of the task, and only indirectly the active priority. We say explicitly that asynchronous queued calls are not affected by normal changes in active priority during the execution of an <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0283">abortable_part</a></code>. Saying that, if a change in the base priority affects the active priority, then we do want the calls reordered, would be inconsistent. It would also require the implementation to maintain a readily accessible list of all queued calls which would not otherwise be necessary.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>11.f</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Several rules were removed or simplified when we changed the rules so that calls due to <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code>s are never moved due to intervening changes in active priority, be they due to protected actions, some other priority inheritance, or changes in the base priority. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>12</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>When more than one <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5#S0150">condition</a></code> of an <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.5#S0262">entry_barrier</a></code> of a protected object becomes True, and more than one of the respective queues is nonempty, the call with the highest priority is selected. If more than one such call has the same priority, the call that is queued on the entry whose declaration is first in textual order in the <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.4#S0251">protected_definition</a></code> is selected.

<li>When more than one alternative of a <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.7#S0270">selective_accept</a></code> is open and has queued calls, an alternative whose queue has the highest-priority call at its head is selected.
