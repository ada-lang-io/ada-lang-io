<p><em>Task dispatching</em> is the process by which a logical thread of control associated with a ready task is selected for execution on a processor. This selection is done during the execution of such a logical thread of control, at certain points called <em>task dispatching points</em>. Such a logical thread of control reaches a task dispatching point whenever it becomes blocked, and when its associated task terminates. [Other task dispatching points are defined throughout this Annex for specific policies.] Below we talk in terms of tasks, but in the context of a parallel construct, a single task can be represented by multiple logical threads of control, each of which can appear separately on a ready queue. <br /></p>

<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00321-01"]} />
<p><em>Task dispatching policies</em> are specified in terms of conceptual <em>ready queues</em> and task states. A ready queue is an ordered list of ready tasks. The first position in a queue is called the <em>head of the queue</em>, and the last position is called the <em>tail of the queue</em>. A task is <em>ready</em> if it is in a ready queue, or if it is running. Each processor has one ready queue for each priority value. At any instant, each ready queue of a processor contains exactly the set of tasks of that priority that are ready for execution on that processor, but are not running on any processor; that is, those tasks that are ready, are not running on any processor, and can be executed using that processor and other available resources. A task can be on the ready queues of more than one processor. <br /></p>

The task selected is the one at the head of the highest priority nonempty ready queue; this task is then removed from all ready queues to which it belongs. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The policy EDF{"_"}Across{"_"}Priorities was replaced by EDF{"_"}Within{"_"}Priorities. A program using EDF{"_"}Across{"_"}Priorities could fail to compile. However, we are not aware of any implementations of EDF{"_"}Across{"_"}Priorities, so it seems unlikely that any such programs exist outside of books and papers. <br />
