<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>The second sentence here is an assume-the-worst rule.

<MarginText>4/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00321-01", "AI12-0119-1"]} />
<p><em>Task dispatching</em> is the process by which a logical thread of control associated with a  ready task is selected for execution on a processor. This selection is done  during the execution of such a logical thread of control, at certain points  called <em>task dispatching points</em>. Such a logical thread of control  reaches a task dispatching point whenever it becomes blocked, and when its associated task  terminates. [Other task dispatching points are defined throughout this Annex for specific policies.] Below we talk in terms of tasks, but in the context of a parallel construct, a single task can be represented by multiple logical threads of control, each of which can appear separately on a ready queue. <br /></p>

<MarginText>4.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>On multiprocessor systems, more than one task can be chosen, at the same time, for execution on more than one processor, as explained below. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>5/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00321-01"]} />
<p><em>Task dispatching policies</em> are specified in terms of conceptual <em>ready queues</em> and task states. A ready queue is an ordered list of ready tasks. The first position in a queue is called the <em>head of the queue</em>, and the last position is called the <em>tail of the queue</em>. A task is <em>ready</em> if it is in a ready queue, or if it is running. Each processor has one ready queue for each priority value. At any instant, each ready queue of a processor contains exactly the set of tasks of that priority that are ready for execution on that processor, but are not running on any processor; that is, those tasks that are ready, are not running on any processor, and can be executed using that processor and other available resources. A task can be on the ready queues of more than one processor. <br /></p>

<MarginText>5.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">

<MarginText>6/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00321-01"]} />
<p>Each processor also has one <em>running task</em>, which is the task currently being executed by that processor. Whenever a task running on a processor reaches a task dispatching point it goes back to one or more ready queues; a task (possibly the same task) is then selected to run on that processor. The task selected is the one at the head of the highest priority nonempty ready queue; this task is then removed from all ready queues to which it belongs. <br /></p>

<MarginText>6.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">

<MarginText>10.1/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00321-01", "AI12-0299-1"]} />
<p>Unless otherwise specified for a task dispatching policy,  an implementation may add additional  points at which task dispatching may occur , in an implementation-defined manner. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
NOTE 1   Clause <a href="../AA-9/">9</a> specifies under which circumstances a task becomes ready. The ready state is affected by the rules for task activation and termination, delay statements, and entry calls. When a task is not ready, it is said to be blocked.<br /></Admonition>

We are not aware of any such implementations, and such behavior was never portable to other implementations, so we do not expect this to matter in practice. <br /></Admonition>

<p>Since implementations are allowed to round all ceiling priorities in subrange System.Priority to System.Priority'Last (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>), an implementation may allow a task of a partition using the Non_Premptive_FIFO_Within_Priorities policy to execute within a protected object without raising its active priority provided the associated protected unit does not contain any subprograms with aspects Interrupt_Handler or Attach_Handler specified, nor does the unit have aspect Interrupt_Priority  specified. When the locking policy (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) is Ceiling_Locking, an implementation taking advantage of this permission shall ensure that a call to Yield_to_Higher that occurs within a protected action uses the ceiling priority of the protected object (rather than the active priority of the task) when determining whether to preempt the task. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>We explicitly require that the ceiling priority be used in calls to Yield_to_Higher in order to prevent a risk of priority inversion and consequent loss of mutual exclusion when Yield_to_Higher is used in a protected object. This requirement might lessen the value of the permission (as the current Ceiling_Priority will have to be maintained in the TCB), but loss of mutual exclusion cannot be tolerated. The primary benefit of the permission (eliminating the need for preemption at the end of a protected action) is still available. As noted above, an implementation-defined locking policy will need to specify the semantics of Yield_to_Higher, including this case. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>9.6/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1", "AI12-0230-1"]} />
<p>The Relative_Deadline aspect shall not be specified on a task or protected interface type. If the Relative_Deadline aspect is specified for a subprogram, the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0348">aspect_definition</a></code> shall be a static expression.<br /></p>


#### Post-Compilation Rules

<MarginText>10/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00357-01", "AI12-0230-1"]} />
<p>If the EDF_Within_Priorities  policy is specified for a partition, then the Ceiling_Locking policy (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) shall also be specified for the partition.<br /></p>

<MarginText>11/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00357-01", "AI12-0230-1"]} />
<p>If the EDF_Within_Priorities  policy appears in a Priority_Specific_Dispatching pragma (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.2#Subclause_D.2.2">D.2.2</a>) in a partition, then the Ceiling_Locking policy (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>) shall also be specified for the partition.<br /></p>

<MarginText>11.a/5</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>Unlike the other language-defined dispatching policies, the semantic description of EDF_Within_Priorities  assumes Ceiling_Locking (and a ceiling priority) in order to make the mapping between deadlines and priorities work. Thus, we require both policies to be specified if EDF is used in the partition. <br /></Admonition>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>12/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00357-01", "AI05-0229-1"]} />
<p>The Relative_Deadline aspect has no effect if it is specified for a subprogram other than the main subprogram.<br /></p>

<MarginText>12.1/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0230-1"]} />
<p>If pragma Generate_Deadlines is in effect, the deadline of a task is recomputed each time it becomes ready. The new deadline is the value of Real_Time.Clock at the time the task is added to a ready queue plus the value returned by Get_Relative_Deadline.<br /></p>

<MarginText>13/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00357-01", "AI05-0229-1", "AI12-0230-1"]} />
<p>The initial absolute deadline for  a task with a specified  Relative_Deadline  is the result of adding the value returned by a call of Real_Time.Clock to the value of  the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> specified as the Relative_Deadline  aspect, where this entire computation , including the call of Real_Time.Clock, is performed  between task creation and the start of its activation. If the aspect Relative_Deadline is not specified, then the initial absolute deadline of a task is the value of Default_Deadline (Ada.Real_Time.Time_Last). The environment task is also given an initial deadline by this rule, using the value of the Relative_Deadline aspect of the main subprogram (if any).<br /></p>

<MarginText>13.a/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="proof" title="Proof: ">
<strong></strong>The environment task is a normal task by <a href="../AA-10/AA-10.2">10.2</a>, so of course this rule applies to it. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>14/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00357-01", "AI12-0230-1"]} />
<p>A task has both an <em>active</em> and a <em>base</em> absolute deadline. These are the same except when the task is inheriting a relative deadline during activation or a rendezvous (see below) or within a protected action (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a>). The procedure Set_Deadline changes the (base) absolute deadline of the task to D. The function Get_Deadline returns the (base) absolute deadline of the task.<br /></p>

<MarginText>14.1/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0230-1"]} />
<p>The procedure Set_Relative_Deadline changes the relative deadline of the task to D. The function Get_Relative_Deadline returns the relative deadline of the task.<br /></p>

<MarginText>14.2/5</MarginText>

<p>The function Get_Last_Release_Time returns the time, as provided by Real_Time.Clock, when the task was last made ready (that is, was added to a ready queue).<br /></p>

<MarginText>15/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00357-01", "AI12-0230-1"]} />
<p>The procedure Delay_Until_And_Set_Deadline delays the calling task until time Delay_Until_Time. When the task becomes ready  again it will have deadline Delay_Until_Time + Deadline_Offset.<br /></p>

<MarginText>16/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00357-01", "AI12-0230-1"]} />
<p>On a system with a single processor, the setting of the deadline of a task to the new value occurs immediately at the first point that is outside the execution of a protected action. If the task is currently on a ready queue it is removed and re-entered onto  the ready queue determined by the rules defined below.<br /></p>

<MarginText>17/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00357-01", "AI12-0230-1"]} />
<p>When EDF_Within_Priorities  is specified for a priority, the  ready queue for that priority is  ordered by deadline. The task at the head of a queue is the one with the earliest deadline.<br /></p>
