<b></b>The priority change is immediate if the target task is on a delay queue or a ready queue outside of a protected action. However, consider when Set{"_"}Priority is called by a task T1 to set the priority of T2, if T2 is blocked, waiting on an entry call queued on a protected object, the entry queue needs to be reordered. Since T1 might have a priority that is higher than the ceiling of the protected object, T1 cannot, in general, do the reordering. One way to implement this is to wake T2 up and have T2 do the work. This is similar to the disentangling of queues that needs to happen when a high-priority task aborts a lower-priority task, which might have a call queued on a protected object with a low ceiling. We have an Implementation Permission in <a href="/docs/arm/AA-D/AA-D.4">D.4</a> to allow this implementation. We could have required an immediate priority change if on a ready queue during a protected action, but that would have required extra checks for ceiling violations to meet Bounded (Run-Time) Error requirements of <a href="/docs/arm/AA-D/AA-D.3">D.3</a> and potentially could cause a protected action to be abandoned in the middle (by raising Program{"_"}Error).

<li>The check was not feasible to implement on all systems, since priority changes might be deferred due to inter-processor communication overhead. The calling task would continue to execute without finding out whether the operation succeeded or not.<br /></li>
<MarginText>10.d_D.5.1</MarginText>
<li>The runtime check would tend to cause intermittent system failures &mdash; how is the caller supposed to know whether the other task happens to have a queued call at any given time? Consider for example an interrupt that needs to trigger a priority change in some task. The interrupt handler could not safely call Set{"_"}Priority without knowing exactly what the other task is doing, or without severely restricting the ceilings used in the system. If the interrupt handler wants to hand the job off to a third task whose job is to call Set{"_"}Priority, this won't help, because one would normally want the third task to have high priority. <br /></li>

NOTE 1   Setting a task's base priority affects task dispatching. First, it can change the task's active priority.

NOTE 2   Under the priority queuing policy, setting a task's base priority has an effect on a queued entry call if the task is blocked waiting for the call. That is, setting the base priority of a task causes the priority of a queued entry call from that task to be updated and the call to be removed and then reinserted in the entry queue at the new priority (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-D/AA-D.4">D.4</a>), unless the call originated from the <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.7#S0282">triggering_statement</a></code> of an <code><a href="/docs/arm/AA-9/AA-9.7#S0280">asynchronous_select</a></code>.<br />
