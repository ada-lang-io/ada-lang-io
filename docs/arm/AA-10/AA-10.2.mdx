<p>An Ada <em>program</em> consists of a set of <em>partitions</em>[, which can execute in parallel with one another, possibly in a separate address space, and possibly on a separate computer.] <br /></p>

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0439-1", "AI12-0448-1"]} />
<p>A partition is a program or part of a program that can be invoked from outside the Ada implementation. [For example, on many systems, a partition can  be an executable file generated by the system linker.] The user can <em>explicitly assign</em> library units to a partition. The assignment is done in an implementation-defined manner. The compilation units included in a partition are those of the explicitly assigned library units, as well as other compilation units <em>needed by</em> those library units. The compilation units needed by a given compilation unit (the <em>needed compilation units</em>) are determined as follows (unless specified otherwise via an implementation-defined <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code>, or by some other implementation-defined means): <br /></p>

<strong></strong>From a run-time point of view, an Ada 95 partition is identical to an Ada 83 program &mdash; implementations were always allowed to provide inter-program communication mechanisms. The additional semantics of partitions is that interfaces between them can be defined to obey normal language rules (as is done in <a href="../AA-E/">Annex E</a>, &ldquo;<a href="../AA-E/">Distributed Systems</a>&rdquo;), whereas interfaces between separate programs had no particular semantics. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>25</MarginText>
<p>The execution of a program consists of the execution of a set of partitions. Further details are implementation defined.

[The execution of the (implicit) <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.1#S0248">task_body</a></code> of the environment task acts as a master for all other tasks created as part of the execution of the partition.

#### Bounded (Run-Time) Errors

<MarginText>26</MarginText>
<p>Once the environment task has awaited the termination of all other tasks of the partition, any further attempt to create a task (during finalization) is a bounded error, and may result in the raising of Program_Error either upon creation or activation of the task.

<strong></strong>The consistency requirement implies that a partition cannot contain two versions of the same compilation unit.

It would be wrong for a partition containing B and C to contain both versions of A. Typically, the implementation would require the use of Version 2 of A, which might require the recompilation of B.

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
The requirement that a partial view with available stream attributes be externally streamable can cause an incompatibility in rare cases. If there is a limited tagged type declared in a pure package with available attributes, and that type is used to declare a private extension in another pure package, and the full type for the private extension has a component of an explicitly limited record type, a protected type, or a type with access discriminants, then the stream attributes will have to be user-specified in the visible part of the package. That is not a requirement for Ada 95, but this combination seems very unlikely in pure packages. Note that this cannot be an incompatibility for a nonlimited type, as all of the types that are allowed in Ada 95 that would require explicitly defined stream attributes are limited (and thus cannot be used as components in a nonlimited type).<br /></Admonition>
