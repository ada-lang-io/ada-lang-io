<li>When an Ada binding to ISO/IEC 60559:2020  that provides (signed) infinities as the result of operations that overflow becomes available, it will be important to allow arithmetic between pure-imaginary and complex operands without requiring the former to be represented as (or promoted to) complex values with a real component of zero. For example, the multiplication of <em>a</em> + <em>b</em>*i by <em>d</em>*i should yield &ndash;<em>b</em>· <em>d</em> + <em>a</em>· <em>d</em>*i, but if one cannot avoid representing the pure-imaginary value <em>d</em>*i as the complex value 0.0 + <em>d</em>*i, then a NaN ("Not-a-Number") could be produced as the result of multiplying <em>a</em> by 0.0 (for example , when <em>a</em> is infinite); the NaN could later trigger an exception.

<strong></strong>The base subtype Real'Base is used for the component type of Complex, the parent type of Imaginary, and the parameter and result types of some of the subprograms to maximize the chances of being able to pass meaningful values into the subprograms and receive meaningful results back. The generic formal parameter Real therefore plays only one role, that of providing the precision to be maintained in complex arithmetic calculations. Thus, the subprograms in Numerics.Generic_Complex_Types share with those in Numerics.Generic_Elementary_Functions, and indeed even with the predefined arithmetic operations (see <a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5">4.5</a>), the property of being free of range checks on input and output, that is , of being able to exploit the base range of the relevant floating point type fully. As a result, the user loses the ability to impose application-oriented bounds on the range of values that the components of a complex variable can acquire; however, it can be argued that few, if any, applications have a naturally square domain (as opposed to a circular domain) anyway. <br /></Admonition>

<p>The arithmetic operations and the Re, Im, Modulus, Argument, and Conjugate functions have their usual mathematical meanings. When applied to a parameter of pure-imaginary type, the &ldquo;imaginary-part&rdquo; function Im yields the value of its parameter, as the corresponding real value. The remaining subprograms have the following meanings: <br /></p>

<li>The Compose_From_Polar function constructs a complex value from the given modulus (radius) and argument (angle).

<MarginText>35</MarginText>
<li>The result of the Argument function is in the quadrant containing the point in the complex plane represented by the parameter X. This may be any quadrant (I through IV); thus, the range of the Argument function is approximately &ndash;&pi; to &pi; (&ndash;Cycle/2.0 to Cycle/2.0, if the parameter Cycle is specified).

Similarly, it is appropriate for the complex arithmetic operations to deliver results with infinite components (and set the zero-divide flag defined by the binding) instead of raising Constraint_Error in the situations defined above, when traps are disabled.

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0091</em>{"}"} Implementations may obtain the result of exponentiation of a complex or pure-imaginary operand by repeated complex multiplication, with arbitrary association of the factors and with a possible final complex reciprocation (when the exponent is negative). Implementations are also permitted to obtain the result of exponentiation of a complex operand, but not of a pure-imaginary operand, by converting the left operand to a polar representation; exponentiating the modulus by the given exponent; multiplying the argument by the given exponent; and reconverting to a Cartesian representation. Because of this implementation freedom, no accuracy requirement is imposed on complex exponentiation (except for the prescribed results given above, which apply regardless of the implementation method chosen). <br /></p>


#### Implementation Advice

<MarginText>56/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0437-1"]} />
<p>Because the usual mathematical meaning of multiplication of a complex operand and a real operand is that of the scaling of both components of the former by the latter, an implementation should not perform this operation by first promoting the real operand to complex type and then performing a full complex multiplication. In systems that, in the future, support an Ada binding to ISO/IEC 60559:2020 , the latter technique will not generate the required result when one of the components of the complex operand is infinite. (Explicit multiplication of the infinite component by the zero component obtained during promotion yields a NaN that propagates into the final result.) Analogous advice applies in the case of multiplication of a complex operand and a pure-imaginary operand, and in the case of division of a complex operand by a real or pure-imaginary operand. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>56.a/2</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-advice">
<strong></strong>Mixed real and complex operations (as well as pure-imaginary and complex operations) should not be performed by converting the real (resp. pure-imaginary) operand to complex.<br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>57/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0437-1"]} />
<p>Likewise, because the usual mathematical meaning of addition of a complex operand and a real operand is that the imaginary operand remains unchanged, an implementation should not perform this operation by first promoting the real operand to complex type and then performing a full complex addition. In implementations in which the Signed_Zeros attribute of the component type is True (and which therefore conform to ISO/IEC 60559:2020  in regard to the handling of the sign of zero in predefined arithmetic operations), the latter technique will not generate the required result when the imaginary component of the complex operand is a negatively signed zero. (Explicit addition of the negative zero to the zero obtained during promotion yields a positive zero.) Analogous advice applies in the case of addition of a complex operand and a pure-imaginary operand, and in the case of subtraction of a complex operand and a real or pure-imaginary operand.<br /></p>

<MarginText>58</MarginText>
<p>Implementations in which Real'Signed_Zeros is True should attempt to provide a rational treatment of the signs of zero results and result components. As one example, the result of the Argument function should have the sign of the imaginary component of the parameter X when the point represented by that parameter lies on the positive real axis; as another, the sign of the imaginary component of the Compose_From_Polar function should be the same as (resp., the opposite of) that of the Argument parameter when that parameter has a value of zero and the Modulus parameter has a nonnegative (resp., negative) value. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>The branch cuts come from the fact that the functions in question are really multi-valued in the complex domain, and that we have to pick one <em>principal value</em> to be the result of the function. Evidently we have much freedom in choosing where the branch cuts lie. However, we are adhering to the following principles which seem to lead to the more <em>natural</em> definitions: <br /></Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>19.b/2</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>A branch cut should not intersect the real axis at a place where the corresponding real function is well-defined (in other words, the complex function should be an extension of the corresponding real function).<br /></li>
<MarginText>19.c/2</MarginText>
<li>Because all the functions in question are analytic, to ensure power series validity for the principal value, the branch cuts should be invariant by complex conjugation.<br /></li>
<MarginText>19.d/2</MarginText>
<li>For odd functions, to ensure that the principal value remains an odd function, the branch cuts should be invariant by reflection in the origin. <br /></li>
</ul>
</AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>20/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00185-01"]} />
<p>The computed results of the mathematically multivalued functions are rendered single-valued by the following conventions, which are meant to imply that the principal branch is an analytic continuation of the corresponding real-valued function in Numerics.Generic_Elementary_Functions. (For Arctan and Arccot, the single-argument function in question is that obtained from the two-argument version by fixing the second argument to be its default value.) <br /></p>

<MarginText>21</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>The real component of the result of the Sqrt and Arccosh functions is nonnegative.<br /></li>
<MarginText>22</MarginText>
<li>The same convention applies to the imaginary component of the result of the Log function as applies to the result of the natural-cycle version of the Argument function of Numerics.Generic_Complex_Types (see <a href="../AA-G/AA-G.1#Subclause_G.1.1">G.1.1</a>).<br /></li>
<MarginText>23</MarginText>

#### Dynamic Semantics

<MarginText>27</MarginText>
<p>The exception Numerics.Argument_Error is raised by the exponentiation operator, signaling a parameter value outside the domain of the corresponding mathematical function, when the value of the left operand is zero and the real component of the exponent (or the exponent itself, when it is of real type) is zero.<br /></p>

<MarginText>28</MarginText>
<p>The exception Constraint_Error is raised, signaling a pole of the mathematical function (analogous to dividing by zero), in the following cases, provided that Complex_Types.Real'Machine_Overflows is True: <br /></p>

<MarginText>29</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>by the Log, Cot, and Coth functions, when the value of the parameter X is zero;<br /></li>
<MarginText>30</MarginText>
<li>by the exponentiation operator, when the value of the left operand is zero and the real component of the exponent (or the exponent itself, when it is of real type) is negative;<br /></li>

<li>by the Arctan and Arccot functions, when the value of the parameter X is ± <em>i</em>;<br /></li>
<MarginText>32</MarginText>
<li>by the Arctanh and Arccoth functions, when the value of the parameter X is ± 1.0. <br /></li>
</ul>
<MarginText>33</MarginText>
<p>[Constraint_Error can also be raised when a finite result overflows (see <a href="../AA-G/AA-G.2#Subclause_G.2.6">G.2.6</a>); this may occur for parameter values sufficiently <em>near</em> poles, and, in the case of some of the functions, for parameter values having components of sufficiently large magnitude.] When Complex_Types.Real'Machine_Overflows is False, the result at poles is unspecified. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">

Similarly, it is appropriate for the complex elementary functions to deliver results with an infinite component (and set the zero-divide flag defined by the binding) instead of raising Constraint_Error at poles, when traps are disabled. Finally, such a binding should also specify the behavior of the complex elementary functions, when sensible, given parameters with infinite components. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>36</MarginText>
<ul>
<li>When the parameter X has the value zero, the Sqrt, Sin, Arcsin, Tan, Arctan, Sinh, Arcsinh, Tanh, and Arctanh functions yield a result of zero; the Exp, Cos, and Cosh functions yield a result of one; the Arccos and Arccot functions yield a real result; and the Arccoth function yields an imaginary result.<br /></li>
<MarginText>37</MarginText>
<li>When the parameter X has the value one, the Sqrt function yields a result of one; the Log, Arccos, and Arccosh functions yield a result of zero; and the Arcsin function yields a real result.<br /></li>

</ul>
<MarginText>41/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00434-01"]} />
<ul>
<li>When the parameter X has the value &ndash;1.0, the Log function yields an imaginary result; and the Arcsin and Arccos functions yield a real result.<br /></li>
<MarginText>42</MarginText>
<li>When the parameter X has the value ± <em>i</em>, the Log function yields an imaginary result.<br /></li>
<MarginText>43</MarginText>
<li>Exponentiation by a zero exponent yields the value one. Exponentiation by a unit exponent yields the value of the left operand (as a complex value). Exponentiation of the value one yields the value one. Exponentiation of the value zero yields the value zero. <br /></li>

<MarginText>43.a</MarginText>

<p>The nongeneric equivalent packages can  be actual instantiations of the generic package with the appropriate predefined nongeneric equivalent of Numerics.Generic_Complex_Types, though that is not required; if they are, then the latter shall have been obtained by actual instantiation of Numerics.Generic_Complex_Types.<br /></p>

<MarginText>47</MarginText>
<p>The exponentiation operator may be implemented in terms of the Exp and Log functions. Because this implementation yields poor accuracy in some parts of the domain, no accuracy requirement is imposed on complex exponentiation.<br /></p>

<MarginText>48</MarginText>
<p>The implementation of the Exp function of a complex parameter X is allowed to raise the exception Constraint_Error, signaling overflow, when the real component of X exceeds an unspecified threshold that is approximately log(Complex_Types.Real'Safe_Last). This permission recognizes the impracticality of avoiding overflow in the marginal case that the exponential of the real component of X exceeds the safe range of Complex_Types.Real but both components of the final result do not. Similarly, the Sin and Cos (resp., Sinh and Cosh) functions are allowed to raise the exception Constraint_Error, signaling overflow, when the absolute value of the imaginary (resp., real) component of the parameter X exceeds an unspecified threshold that is approximately log(Complex_Types.Real'Safe_Last) + log(2.0). This permission recognizes the impracticality of avoiding overflow in the marginal case that the hyperbolic sine or cosine of the imaginary (resp., real) component of X exceeds the safe range of Complex_Types.Real but both components of the final result do not. <br /></p>


#### Implementation Advice

<MarginText>49</MarginText>
<p>Implementations in which Complex_Types.Real'Signed_Zeros is True should attempt to provide a rational treatment of the signs of zero results and result components. For example, many of the complex elementary functions have components that are odd functions of one of the parameter components; in these cases, the result component should have the sign of the parameter component at the origin. Other complex elementary functions have zero components whose sign is opposite that of a parameter component at the origin, or is always positive or always negative. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>The parenthesized and comma-separated form is the form produced by Put on output (see below), and also by list-directed output in Fortran. The other allowed forms match several common styles of edit-directed output in Fortran, allowing most preexisting Fortran data files containing complex data to be read easily. When such files contain complex values with no separation between the real and imaginary components, the user will have to read those components separately, using an instance of Text_IO.Float_IO. <br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>This rule is the one proposed in LSN-1051. Other rules were considered, including one that would have read &ldquo;Outputs the value of the parameter Item to the given string, following the same rule as for output to a file, using a value for Fore such that the sequence of characters output exactly fills, or comes closest to filling, the string; in the latter case, the string is filled by inserting one extra blank immediately after the comma.&rdquo; While this latter rule might be considered the closest analogue to the rule for output to a string in Text_IO.Float_IO, it requires a more difficult and inefficient implementation involving special cases when the integer part of one component is substantially longer than that of the other and the string is too short to allow both to be preceded by blanks. Unless such a special case applies, the latter rule might produce better columnar output if several such strings are ultimately output to a file, but very nearly the same output can be produced by outputting to the file directly, with the appropriate value of Fore; in any case, it might validly be assumed that output to a string is intended for further computation rather than for display, so that the precise formatting of the string to achieve a particular appearance is not the major concern. <br /></Admonition>
