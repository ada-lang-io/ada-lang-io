#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>Implementations shall provide a user-selectable mode in which the accuracy and other numeric performance requirements detailed in the following subclauses are observed. This mode, referred to as the <i>strict mode</i>, may or may not be the default mode; it directly affects the results of the predefined arithmetic operations of real types and the results of the subprograms in children of the Numerics package, and indirectly affects the operations in other language defined packages. Implementations shall also provide the opposing mode, which is known as the <i>relaxed mode</i>. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason">
<b></b>On the assumption that the users of an implementation that does not support the Numerics Annex have no particular need for numerical performance, such an implementation has no obligation to meet any particular requirements in this area. On the other hand, users of an implementation that does support the Numerics Annex are provided with a way of ensuring that their programs achieve a known level of numerical performance and that the performance is portable to other such implementations. The relaxed mode is provided to allow implementers to offer an efficient but not fully accurate alternative in the case that the strict mode entails a time overhead that some users may find excessive. In some of its areas of impact, the relaxed mode may be fully equivalent to the strict mode. <br />

## G.2.1  Model of Floating Point Arithmetic

<MarginText>1_G.2.1</MarginText>
<p>In the strict mode, the predefined operations of a floating point type shall satisfy the accuracy requirements specified here and shall avoid or signal overflow in the situations described. This behavior is presented in terms of a model of floating point arithmetic that builds on the concept of the canonical form (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-A/AA-A.5#Subclause_A.5.3">A.5.3</a>). <br /></p>


#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>2_G.2.1</MarginText>
<p>Associated with each floating point type is an infinite set of model numbers. The model numbers of a type are used to define the accuracy requirements that have to be satisfied by certain predefined operations of the type; through certain attributes of the model numbers, they are also used to explain the meaning of a user-declared floating point type declaration. The model numbers of a derived type are those of the parent type; the model numbers of a subtype are those of its type.<br /></p>

<MarginText>3_G.2.1</MarginText>
<p>The <i>model numbers</i> of a floating point type T are zero and all the values expressible in the canonical form (for the type T), in which <i>mantissa</i> has T'Model{"_"}Mantissa digits and <i>exponent</i> has a value greater than or equal to T'Model{"_"}Emin. (These attributes are defined in <a href="/docs/arm/AA-G/AA-G.2#Subclause_G.2.2">G.2.2</a>.) <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>3.a_G.2.1</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<b></b>The model is capable of describing the behavior of most existing hardware that has a mantissa-exponent representation. As applied to a type T, it is parameterized by the values of T'Machine{"_"}Radix, T'Model{"_"}Mantissa, T'Model{"_"}Emin, T'Safe{"_"}First, and T'Safe{"_"}Last. The values of these attributes are determined by how, and how well, the hardware behaves. They in turn determine the set of model numbers and the safe range of the type, which figure in the accuracy and range (overflow avoidance) requirements.<br />

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
In hardware that is free of arithmetic anomalies, T'Model{"_"}Mantissa, T'Model{"_"}Emin, T'Safe{"_"}First, and T'Safe{"_"}Last will yield the same values as T'Machine{"_"}Mantissa, T'Machine{"_"}Emin, T'Base'First, and T'Base'Last, respectively, and the model numbers in the safe range of the type T will coincide with the machine numbers of the type T. In less perfect hardware, it is not possible for the model-oriented attributes to have these optimal values, since the hardware, by definition, and therefore the implementation, cannot conform to the stringencies of the resulting model; in this case, the values yielded by the model-oriented parameters have to be made more conservative (that is, have to be penalized), with the result that the model numbers are more widely separated than the machine numbers, and the safe range is a subrange of the base range. The implementation will then be able to conform to the requirements of the weaker model defined by the sparser set of model numbers and the smaller safe range. <br />
</Admonition>
</AnnotatedOnly>

<MarginText>4_G.2.1</MarginText>
<p>A <i>model interval</i> of a floating point type is any interval whose bounds are model numbers of the type. The <i>model interval</i> of a type T <i>associated with a value</i> <i>v</i> is the smallest model interval of T that includes <i>v</i>. (The model interval associated with a model number of a type consists of that number only.) <br /></p>


#### Implementation Requirements

It also does not cover the accuracy of the predefined attributes of a floating point subtype that yield a value of the type; such operations also yield exact results (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.5#Subclause_3.5.8">3.5.8</a> and <a href="/docs/arm/AA-A/AA-A.5#Subclause_A.5.3">A.5.3</a>). <br />

<MarginText>6_G.2.1</MarginText>
<p>An <i>operand interval</i> is the model interval, of the type specified for the operand of an operation, associated with the value of the operand.<br /></p>

<MarginText>7_G.2.1</MarginText>
<p>For any predefined arithmetic operation that yields a result of a floating point type T, the required bounds on the result are given by a model interval of T (called the <i>result interval</i>) defined in terms of the operand values as follows: <br /></p>

<p>The result interval of an exponentiation is obtained by applying the above rule to the sequence of multiplications defined by the exponent, assuming arbitrary association of the factors, and to the final division in the case of a negative exponent.<br /></p>

<MarginText>10_G.2.1</MarginText>
<p>The result interval of a conversion of a numeric value to a floating point type T is the model interval of T associated with the operand value, except when the source expression is of a fixed point type with a <i>small</i> that is not a power of T'Machine{"_"}Radix or is a fixed point multiplication or division either of whose operands has a <i>small</i> that is not a power of T'Machine{"_"}Radix; in these cases, the result interval is implementation defined. <br /></p>

<MarginText>16.c_G.2.1</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Giving the model numbers the hardware radix, instead of always a radix of two, allows (in conjunction with other changes) some borderline declared types to be represented with less precision than in Ada 83 (that is, with single precision, whereas Ada 83 would have used double precision). Because the lower precision satisfies the requirements of the model (and did so in Ada 83 as well), this change is viewed as a desirable correction of an anomaly, rather than a worrisome inconsistency. (Of course, the wider representation chosen in Ada 83 also remains eligible for selection in Ada 95.)<br />

results in T being represented in double precision in Ada 83 and in single precision in Ada 95. The latter is intuitively correct; the former is counterintuitive. The reason why the double precision type is used in Ada 83 is that Float has model and safe numbers (in Ada 83) with 21 binary digits in their mantissas, as is required to model the hypothesized hexadecimal hardware using a binary radix; thus Float'Last, which is not a model number, is slightly outside the range of safe numbers of the single precision type, making that type ineligible for selection as the representation of T even though it provides adequate precision. In Ada 95, Float'Last (the same value as before) is a model number and is in the safe range of Float on the hypothesized hardware, making Float eligible for the representation of T. <br />

<MarginText>1_G.2.3</MarginText>
<p>In the strict mode, the predefined arithmetic operations of a fixed point type shall satisfy the accuracy requirements specified here and shall avoid or signal overflow in the situations described. <br /></p>


#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>2_G.2.3</MarginText>
<p>The accuracy requirements for the predefined fixed point arithmetic operations and conversions, and the results of relations on fixed point operands, are given below. <br /></p>

<MarginText>3_G.2.3</MarginText>
<p>The operands of the fixed point adding operators, absolute value, and comparisons have the same type. These operations are required to yield exact results, unless they overflow.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4_G.2.3</MarginText>
<p>Multiplications and divisions are allowed between operands of any two fixed point types; the result has to be (implicitly or explicitly) converted to some other numeric type. For purposes of defining the accuracy rules, the multiplication or division and the conversion are treated as a single operation whose accuracy depends on three types (those of the operands and the result). For decimal fixed point types, the attribute T'Round may be used to imply explicit conversion with rounding (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.5#Subclause_3.5.10">3.5.10</a>).<br /></p>

<MarginText>5_G.2.3</MarginText>
<p>When the result type is a floating point type, the accuracy is as given in <a href="/docs/arm/AA-G/AA-G.2#Subclause_G.2.1">G.2.1</a>. For some combinations of the operand and result types in the remaining cases, the result is required to belong to a small set of values called the <i>perfect result set</i>; for other combinations, it is required merely to belong to a generally larger and implementation-defined set of values called the <i>close result set</i>. When the result type is a decimal fixed point type, the perfect result set contains a single value; thus, operations on decimal types are always fully specified. <br /></p>

The interval 0.0 .. 1.0 is partitioned into <i>K</i> subintervals. <i>K</i> is chosen randomly between 4 and 25 for each repetition of the test, along with the boundaries of the subintervals (subject to the constraint that at least 2 of the subintervals have a width of 0.001 or more). 5000 random floating point numbers are generated. The counts of random numbers falling into each subinterval are tallied and compared with the expected counts, which are proportional to the widths of the subintervals. The number of degrees of freedom for the chi-square test is <i>K</i>&ndash;1.<br /></li>

<li>Gap Test. The bounds of a range <i>A</i> .. <i>B</i>, with 0.0 &le; <i>A</i> {"<"} <i>B</i> &le; 1.0, are chosen randomly for each repetition of the test, subject to the constraint that 0.2 &le; <i>B</i>&ndash;<i>A</i> &le; 0.6. Random floating point numbers are generated until 5000 falling into the range <i>A</i> .. <i>B</i> have been encountered. Each of these 5000 is preceded by a &ldquo;gap&rdquo; (of length greater than or equal to 0) of consecutive random numbers not falling into the range <i>A</i> .. <i>B</i>. The counts of gaps of each length from 0 to 15, and of all lengths greater than 15 lumped together, are tallied and compared with the expected counts. Let <i>P</i> = <i>B</i>&ndash;<i>A</i>. The probability that a gap has a length of <i>L</i> is (1&ndash;<i>P</i>) <i>L</i> · <i>P</i> for <i>L</i> &le; 15, while the probability that a gap has a length of 16 or more is (1&ndash;<i>P</i>) 16. The number of degrees of freedom for the chi-square test is 16.<br /></li>
<MarginText>4.d_G.2.5</MarginText>
<li>Permutation Test. 5000 tuples of 4 different random floating point numbers are generated. (An entire 4-tuple is discarded in the unlikely event that it contains any two exactly equal components.) The counts of each of the 4! = 24 possible relative orderings of the components of the 4-tuples are tallied and compared with the expected counts. Each of the possible relative orderings has an equal probability. The number of degrees of freedom for the chi-square test is 23.<br /></li>
<MarginText>4.e_G.2.5</MarginText>
<li>Increasing-Runs Test. Random floating point numbers are generated until 5000 increasing runs have been observed. An &ldquo;increasing run&rdquo; is a sequence of random numbers in strictly increasing order; it is followed by a random number that is strictly smaller than the preceding random number. (A run under construction is entirely discarded in the unlikely event that one random number is followed immediately by an exactly equal random number.) The decreasing random number that follows an increasing run is discarded and not included with the next increasing run. The counts of increasing runs of each length from 1 to 4, and of all lengths greater than 4 lumped together, are tallied and compared with the expected counts. The probability that an increasing run has a length of <i>L</i> is 1/<i>L</i>! &ndash; 1/(<i>L</i>+1)! for <i>L</i> &le; 4, while the probability that an increasing run has a length of 5 or more is 1/5!. The number of degrees of freedom for the chi-square test is 4.<br /></li>

<li>Decreasing-Runs Test. The test is similar to the Increasing Runs Test, but with decreasing runs.<br /></li>
<MarginText>4.g_G.2.5</MarginText>
<li>Maximum-of-<i>t</i> Test (with <i>t</i> = 5). 5000 tuples of 5 random floating point numbers are generated. The maximum of the components of each 5-tuple is determined and raised to the 5th power. The uniformity of the resulting values over the range 0.0 .. 1.0 is tested as in the Proportional Distribution Test. <br /></li>

<li>Equidistribution Test. In each repetition of the test, a number <i>R</i> between 2 and 30 is chosen randomly, and Numerics.Discrete{"_"}Random is instantiated with an integer subtype whose range is 1 .. <i>R</i>. 5000 integers are generated randomly from this range.

The counts of hands containing exactly <i>K</i> different denominations (1 &le; <i>K</i> &le; 5) are tallied and compared with the expected counts. The probability that a hand contains exactly <i>K</i> different denominations is given by a formula in Knuth. The number of degrees of freedom for the chi-square test is 4.<br /></li>

<li>Coupon Collector's Test. Numerics.Discrete{"_"}Random is instantiated in each repetition of the test with an integer subtype whose range is 1 .. <i>R</i>, where <i>R</i> varies systematically from 2 to 11. Integers are generated randomly from this range until each value in the range has occurred, and the number <i>K</i> of integers generated is recorded. This constitutes a &ldquo;coupon collector's segment&rdquo; of length <i>K</i>. 2000 such segments are generated. The counts of segments of each length from <i>R</i> to <i>R</i>+29, and of all lengths greater than <i>R</i>+29 lumped together, are tallied and compared with the expected counts.

<li>Craps Test (Lengths of Games). Numerics.Discrete{"_"}Random is instantiated once with an integer subtype whose range is 1 .. 6 (representing the six numbers on a die). 5000 craps games are played, and their lengths are recorded. (The length of a craps game is the number of rolls of the pair of dice required to produce a win or a loss. A game is won on the first roll if the dice show 7 or 11; it is lost if they show 2, 3, or 12. If the dice show some other sum on the first roll, it is called the <i>point</i>, and the game is won if and only if the point is rolled again before a 7 is rolled.) The counts of games of each length from 1 to 18, and of all lengths greater than 18 lumped together, are tallied and compared with the expected counts. For 2 &le; <i>S</i> &le; 12, let <i>D</i> <i>S</i> be the probability that a roll of a pair of dice shows the sum <i>S</i>, and let <i>Q</i> <i>S</i>(<i>L</i>) = <i>D</i> <i>S</i> · (1 &ndash; (<i>D</i> <i>S</i> + <i>D</i> 7)) <i>L</i>&ndash;2 · (<i>D</i> <i>S</i> + <i>D</i> 7). Then, the probability that a game has a length of 1 is <i>D</i> 7 + <i>D</i> 11 + <i>D</i> 2 + <i>D</i> 3 + <i>D</i> 12 and, for <i>L</i> {">"} 1, the probability that a game has a length of <i>L</i> is <i>Q</i> 4(<i>L</i>) + <i>Q</i> 5(<i>L</i>) + <i>Q</i> 6(<i>L</i>) + <i>Q</i> 8(<i>L</i>) + <i>Q</i> 9(<i>L</i>) + <i>Q</i> 10(<i>L</i>).

<li>Craps Test (Lengths of Passes). This test is similar to the last, but enough craps games are played for 3000 losses to occur. A string of wins followed by a loss is called a <i>pass</i>, and its length is the number of wins preceding the loss. The counts of passes of each length from 0 to 7, and of all lengths greater than 7 lumped together, are tallied and compared with the expected counts. For <i>L</i> &ge; 0, the probability that a pass has a length of <i>L</i> is <i>W</i> <i>L</i> · (1&ndash;<i>W</i>), where <i>W</i>, the probability that a game ends in a win, is 244.0/495.0.

<li>Collision Test. Numerics.Discrete{"_"}Random is instantiated once with an integer or enumeration type representing binary bits. 15 successive calls on the Random function are used to obtain the bits of a 15-bit binary integer between 0 and 32767. 3000 such integers are generated, and the number of collisions (integers previously generated) is counted and compared with the expected count. A chi-square test is not used to assess the number of collisions; rather, the limits on the number of collisions, corresponding to the 2.5 and 97.5 percentage points, are (from formulas in Knuth) 112 and 154. The test passes if and only if the number of collisions is in this range. <br /></li>

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0453-1"]} />
<p>When an exception is not raised, the result of evaluating a real function of an instance <i>CT</i> of Numerics.Generic{"_"}Complex{"_"}Types (that is, a function that yields a value of subtype <i>CT</i>.Real'Base or <i>CT</i>.Imaginary) belongs to a result interval defined as for a real elementary function (see <a href="/docs/arm/AA-G/AA-G.2#Subclause_G.2.4">G.2.4</a>).<br /></p>

<p>When an exception is not raised, each component of the result of evaluating a complex function of such an instance, or of an instance of Numerics.Generic{"_"}Complex{"_"}Elementary{"_"}Functions obtained by instantiating the latter with <i>CT</i> (that is, a function that yields a value of subtype <i>CT</i>.Complex), also belongs to a <i>result interval</i>. The result intervals for the components of the result are either defined by a <i>maximum relative error</i> bound or by a <i>maximum box error</i> bound. When the result interval for the real (resp., imaginary) component is defined by maximum relative error, it is defined as for that of a real function, relative to the exact value of the real (resp., imaginary) part of the result of the corresponding mathematical function. When defined by maximum box error, the result interval for a component of the result is the smallest model interval of <i>CT</i>.Real that contains all the values of the corresponding part of <i>f</i> · (1.0 + <i>d</i>), where <i>f</i> is the exact complex value of the corresponding mathematical function at the given parameter values, <i>d</i> is complex, and |<i>d</i>| is less than or equal to the given maximum box error. The function delivers a value that belongs to the result interval (or a value both of whose components belong to their respective result intervals) when both bounds of the result interval(s) belong to the safe range of <i>CT</i>.Real; otherwise, <br /></p>

Thus, for example, the box containing the computed result of a complex function whose mathematical result has a large modulus but lies very close to the imaginary axis might well straddle that axis, allowing the real component of the computed result to have the wrong sign. In this case, the distance between the computed result and the mathematical result is, nevertheless, a small fraction of the modulus of the mathematical result. <br />

For the Exp function, and for the forward hyperbolic (resp., trigonometric) functions, the maximum relative error given above likewise applies only when the absolute value of the imaginary (resp., real) component of the parameter X (or the absolute value of the parameter itself, in the case of the Exp function with a parameter of pure-imaginary type) is less than or equal to the angle threshold.

<p>The prescribed results specified in <a href="/docs/arm/AA-G/AA-G.1#Subclause_G.1.2">G.1.2</a> for certain functions at particular parameter values take precedence over the error bounds; effectively, they narrow to a single value the result interval allowed by the error bounds for a component of the result. Additional rules with a similar effect are given below for certain inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions, at particular parameter values for which a component of the mathematical result is transcendental. In each case, the accuracy rule, which takes precedence over the error bounds, is that the result interval for the stated result component is the model interval of <i>CT</i>.Real associated with the component's exact mathematical value. The cases in question are as follows: <br /></p>

The rule is that the result belongs to the smallest model interval of <i>CT</i>.Real that contains both boundaries of the quadrant corresponding to the principal branch. This rule also takes precedence over the maximum error bounds, effectively narrowing the result interval allowed by them.<br /></p>
