<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>This Annex describes features for writing mixed-language programs. General interface support is presented first; then specific support for C, COBOL, and Fortran is defined, in terms of language interface packages for each of these languages. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification">
<b></b>This Annex is not a &ldquo;Specialized Needs&rdquo; annex. Every implementation must support all nonoptional features defined here (mainly the package Interfaces). <br />
</Admonition>

#### Language Design Principles

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>1.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note">
Ada should have strong support for mixed-language programming. <br />
</Admonition>

#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>2/3</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI05-0229-1", "AI05-0262-1", "AI05-0299-1"]} />
<p>Support for interfacing to any foreign language is optional. However, an implementation shall not provide any optional aspect, attribute, library unit, or pragma having the same name as an aspect, attribute, library unit, or pragma (respectively) specified in the subclauses of this Annex unless the provided construct is either as specified in those subclauses or is more limited in capability than that required by those subclauses. A program that attempts to use an unsupported capability of this Annex shall either be identified by the implementation before run time or shall raise an exception at run time. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>2.a/3</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<b></b>The intent is that the same rules apply for the optional parts of language interfacing as apply for Specialized Needs Annexes. See <a href="/docs/arm/AA-1/AA-1.1#Subclause_1.1.3">1.1.3</a> for a discussion of the purpose of these rules. <br />
