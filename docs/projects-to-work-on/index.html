<p>In this section, some projects, issues, improvements or ideas are presented for
the larger Ada community to work together and make Ada better. However, if you
are a newcomer, this section is also for you! If you are looking for practical
topics to train your skill and help the community, this is a great starting
point.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-is-this-list-structured">How is this list structured?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How is this list structured?" title="Direct link to How is this list structured?" href="/docs/projects-to-work-on#how-is-this-list-structured">​</a></h2>
<p>The proposals are ordered by topic. Within each topic, they are ordered in terms
of difficulty, that way, regardless of your experience with Ada or with the
topic at hand, there should always be something for everybody.</p>
<p>Notice that the selection of projects here is not exhaustive and will never
be. The criteria for adding new points to this list is that the projects or
topics should have a noticeable impact on the community. Individual ideas or
personal projects will not be promoted here, but feel free to work on those too!</p>
<h1>List of projects</h1>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="ada-advocacy">Ada Advocacy<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ada Advocacy" title="Direct link to Ada Advocacy" href="/docs/projects-to-work-on#ada-advocacy">​</a></h2>
<p>Ada does not have a lot going in the marketing department, let&#x27;s fix that! All
these proposals apply regardless of your Ada experience, each person will have
their own take and point of view.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helping newcomers:</strong> Ada has a constant influx of new and curious people
wanting to try the language and learn it. One of the most important parts of
the learning experience is the community and how it welcomes and aids
<em>newbies.</em> The Ada community could use a few more people willing to help and
guide new programmers with their first few steps into the language. You will
find links to various sites where learners frequently ask questions in the
<strong>Community</strong> column of the ada-lang.io footer.</li>
<li><strong>Blog posts:</strong> writing blogs is always a nice way to share knowledge,
experience, tips and anything in between. The Ada community could have a
little more of that. And don&#x27;t forget to share the blog posts with the
community afterwards!</li>
<li><strong>Forums, social media and language discussions:</strong> there are a lot of general
discussions going on in the Internet, we should make Ada have a bit more
presence there (if it is suitable!).<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> the <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Awesome WASM Lang
repository</a> lists all the
languages that support targetting WASM. Ada supports WASM! <del>but it is not
on the list. It would be great if someone did a Pull Request.</del> Thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/mgrojo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mgrojo</a> for his <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs/pull/135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull
request</a>. It
didn&#x27;t even require writing a single line of Ada code, it is that simple!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conferences:</strong> if you feel confident with your speaking and teaching skill,
going to a conference and showing off Ada is a great way to attract the
curious eyes of the audience. The topics here are also quite broad, ranging
from simple and short tutorial all the way to niche and advanced features of
the language.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="documentation">Documentation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Documentation" title="Direct link to Documentation" href="/docs/projects-to-work-on#documentation">​</a></h2>
<p>Documentation can easily make or break projects, luckily, Ada is one of the best
documented languages out there, thanks to it being an ISO standard and having
<a href="https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/gnat_rm/html/gnat_rm/gnat_rm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extensive compiler and tooling
documentation</a>.
Nonetheless, things could be much better, specially for individual projects and
libraries. Documentation for individual tools will be listed in their respective
categories. Here are the main places which could use help with their
documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ada-Lang.io:</strong> you can help grow the documentation, guides, experience of
this webpage, which tends to be one of the first resources that new people to
the language take. The <a href="/docs/learn/why-ada/">Learn section</a> could use some extra
hands, specially with the addition completion of <a href="/docs/category/how-tos">How-Tos</a>
and <a href="/docs/category/tips-and-tricks">Tips and Tricks</a>. The addition of SPARK
documentation would also be greatly welcomed.</li>
<li><strong>Ada Wikibook:</strong> the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ada
Wikibook</a> has been a great
source of knowledge for many years and many people. Nonetheless, it could use
some clean-ups, completion and updates related to <em>Ada 2022.</em></li>
<li><strong>SPARK:</strong> SPARK does not have as much documentation as Ada does. This is just
natural as it is a newer system and it is also a much more complex and
advanced one. Therefore, SPARK could use some extra examples, guides and help
from the community.</li>
<li><strong>Improve the Standard Library documentation.</strong> Ada has an advanced Standard
Library that is carefully documented in the Ada standard and in the <a href="https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/gnat_rm/html/gnat_rm/gnat_rm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GNAT
Reference
Manual</a>. However,
there are not many examples regarding its use. It is also not easy to
read/digest documents describing the Standard Library. Better documentation
would be useful for the larger Ada community and newcomers. Writing examples
and documentation for the Standatd Library would also be very useful for new
Ada programmers, as it makes for a wonderful practical learning experience.</li>
<li><strong>Translations:</strong> the Ada community is all over the world and there are many
people who are not fluent in English. If you speak a different language and
you feel like translating content to it would help other people, go ahead!
Luckily, nowadays, most people are somewhat fluent in English to be able to
read it and understand it, so translation work is not as necessary as it used
to be.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="teaching">Teaching<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Teaching" title="Direct link to Teaching" href="/docs/projects-to-work-on#teaching">​</a></h2>
<p>While Ada is a very readable and easy to learn language, its community does not
shine when it comes to diverse and omnipresent documentation. If you would like
to help fix this, here are a few ideas.</p>
<p>For beginners and new Ada programmers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosetta Code</a>:</strong> Rosetta
provides examples and solutions to common problems and tasks in many
programming languages. It serves as a learning resource as well as a
comparison tool between languages. Ada already has a lot of examples, but
still, some are missing compared to other languages. And some of the examples
are quite old and they could be updated and cleaned up. These tasks should be
fairly easy to carry out and they will help you learn Ada along the way!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeeksforGeeks</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tutorials
Point</a>:</strong> these well-known websites have
resources on different languages and topics about them, ranging between simple
syntax elements to solving specific tasks in them. Ada has little to no
presence in them. It would be nice if we could document Ada in them or point
people to use <a href="https://learn.adacore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn Ada</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>For intermediate and seasoned Ada and SPARK users:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/alice-adventures/Alice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alice</a></strong> is a work-in-progress
platform that is focused on teaching Ada and SPARK by focusing on high quality
lessons and solutions (excellence as it is indicated in Alice&#x27;s
documentation). One could help develop its infrastructure, testing and adding
lessons and tasks to it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://exercism.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exercism</a></strong> is a learning platform where students
solve problems (with varying degrees of complexity) and then a tutor or
reviewer can give them feedback if necessary. Ada used to have an entry in the
website <a href="https://github.com/exercism/DEPRECATED-ada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see deprecated
repo</a>. However, due to the lack of
exercises and people willing to carry out the work maintaining it and helping
students, it is no longer available. It would be great if it could be brought
back. Nonetheless, Alice, see above, is trying to achive a similar goal while
being focused on Ada/SPARK.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="toolchains">Toolchains<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Toolchains" title="Direct link to Toolchains" href="/docs/projects-to-work-on#toolchains">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://alire.ada.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alire</a></strong> is one of the most important tools for the
Ada community, regardless of the experience that one may have with the
language. Alire is always looking for testers for new releases, feedback,
improvements and fixes. If you are looking for a project to help with, Alire
would be great!<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Add new crates:</strong> one of the easiest ways to help Alire is by adding Ada
applications and libraries (called crates) to the index and making them
available for the entire community.</li>
<li><strong>Help with the documentation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Help build Alire in new architectures (for example RISC-V).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improve the <a href="https://github.com/alire-project/GNAT-FSF-builds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compiler
packaging</a></strong> of Alire by
adding a new architecture and testing it more.</li>
<li><strong>Package <a href="https://github.com/AdaCore/gnat-llvm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GNAT-LLVM</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operating System&#x27;s Packages:</strong> Ada is not widely packaged in a lot of
distributions&#x27; default package manager. A lot of people initially try to use
the system&#x27;s provided package only to find out that Ada is not packaged or
poorly packaged. It would be very benefitial to a lot of new (and seasoned)
Ada users to have a nice out-of-the-box experience with their operating
system.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Guix:</strong> help package a working toolchain for the supported
architectures. Package Alire.</li>
<li><strong>OpenSUSE:</strong> extend the <code>gcc-ada</code> packaging to all the supported
architectures. Create cross-compilation toolchains. Package Alire.</li>
<li><strong>RedHat and Fedora:</strong> improve the support of the Ada toolchain. Package
Alire.</li>
<li><strong>FreeBSD:</strong> improve the current port and extend support to other
architectures. Update the packaged version.</li>
<li><strong>NetBSD:</strong> update the compiler and patches. Check support for NetBSD 10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ravenports.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ravenports</a></strong> is a package manager similar to
<a href="https://www.pkgsrc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pkgsrc</a>. Help test it, package programs in it and
help grow its OS support.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="libraries-and-tools">Libraries and Tools<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Libraries and Tools" title="Direct link to Libraries and Tools" href="/docs/projects-to-work-on#libraries-and-tools">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="bindings">Bindings<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bindings" title="Direct link to Bindings" href="/docs/projects-to-work-on#bindings">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create bindings to well-known tools and libraries:</strong> not a lot of tools are
implemented in Ada and not all need to be! But it is always more convenient if
Ada users could just start using a wider variety of tools and libraries. For
that reason, it would be greatly benefitial to have more Ada bindings to
well-known and widely-used projects so that both, new and seasoned Ada
programers, can easily pick them up and start using their functionality.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideas:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ImGUI</a></strong> is a widely used GUI
library. There is already an
<a href="https://github.com/michael-hardeman/ImGui-Ada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ada-binding</a>, but it could
be updated and added to Alire.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stb</a></strong> is a collection of C
header-only utilities in the public domain.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raylib</a></strong> is a collection of simple
commonly-used utilities and libraries geared towards creating videogames.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ccv</a></strong> and
<strong><a href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenCV</a></strong> are libraries geared towards computer
vision and processing.</li>
<li><strong>And many more!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/charlie5/swig4ada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SWIG4Ada</a>:</strong> Ada has outstanding
support for creating bindings to other languages, specially C, Fortran and
Cobol. GCC also has a method for creating bindings to C++ projects, however,
it is quite limited with what it can do. SWIG4Ada implements support for Ada
into the SWIG binding generator. It is still incomplete and it could use some
more hands.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="graphics-and-games">Graphics and Games<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Graphics and Games" title="Direct link to Graphics and Games" href="/docs/projects-to-work-on#graphics-and-games">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Lucretia/sdlada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDLAda</a>:</strong> the bindings to SDL still
have some missing pieces/functions that need to be finalised, which can be
found in the link&#x27;s README page. This could be a great start for people
wanting to get into game/graphics programming with Ada.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/AdaCore/gtkada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GTKAda</a></strong> is the GTK binding to Ada. It
is poorly documented, there are not many tutorials nor blogposts about using
it. Therefore, documentation would be a great starting point for someone
wanting to get into GTK and Ada. Moreover, the bindings still target GTK3. If
you are feeling adventurous, you may want to try and help update it to GTK4!</li>
</ul>

<p>The Ada ecosystem sports some of the most interesting kernels/OSes out
there. Operating System development tends to be labeled as an advanced
topic. However, if you are learning, thanks to Ada&#x27;s clear syntax, it becomes
much easier to understand them, use them and even contribute to an OS. Here is a
list of kernels/OSes written in pure Ada/SPARK that may greatly benefit from the
community:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://ironclad.cx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ironclad</a></strong> is a fairly new kernel that strives to be
POSIX compatible. It partially written in SPARK, making it much more robust
and safe by default. It aims to support x86, ARM and RISC-V architectures. You
can contribute to it or you can help grow the
<a href="https://github.com/streaksu/Gloire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gloire</a> OS distribution, which uses
Ironclad as its kernel.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jgrivera67/HiRTOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HiRTOS</a></strong> is a high integrity RTOS
kernel as well as a separation kernel written in SPARK. Go and give it a try!
One can even install it using Alire! It currently targets the ARM Cortex-R52
CPU. One could try and port it to a different CPU.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://muen.codelabs.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Muen</a></strong> is a separation kernel fully written in
SPARK. It has been certified by some large military bodies for their internal
use. It also sports some drivers fully written in SPARK!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://m2os.unican.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M2OS</a></strong> is a small RTOS that was created from the
same people behind the Ada OS <a href="https://marte.unican.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marte</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some well known Operating Systems that allow users to run Ada programs
in them directly even if they are written in a different language. You may want
to use them, improve the Ada support they have or write examples or blog posts
about their use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.rtems.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTEMS</a></strong> is a POSIX RTOS that is widely used in
the aerospace industry. It has official Ada support. However, its use is not
clearly documented nor widely known about; this could be fixed.</li>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/AdaCore/Ada_Drivers_Library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ada Drivers Library</a></strong> is a
collection of drivers for microcontollers and embedded boards. You can help by
utilising it, testing the built-in drivers and specially by helping improve
drivers and boards that are not yet present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create more HALs:</strong> HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) is a piece of code that
abstracts the device away from the code. This is what generally drivers do. By
implementing a HAL the low level aspects of the hardware are not needed in
order to program the device, which makes the experience of embedded
programming a lot more pleasant and comprehensible. Ada has quite a few HALs
(see the Ada Drivers Library), but we are nowhere near to other communities,
even though we exceed at embedded programming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improve <a href="https://github.com/AdaCore/svd2ada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">svd2ada</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AdaCore/startup-gen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">startup-gen</a>.</strong> These two tools allow
for the quick creation of a initial HAL layer. There are a few issues and
limitations in their Github page which could be improved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Help the <a href="https://github.com/gabriele-galeotti/SweetAda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SweetAda</a>
development framework.</strong> SweetAda is a terrific framework designed to bring
Ada support to as many architectures as possible. It would greatly benefit
from more testing and specially documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improve support for tasking profiles in embedded OSes (Jorvik, Ravenscar).</strong>
This is a very advanced topic, but an important one. Embedded systems
generally do not support tasking due to the limited support that the runtime
implementation has for them. Therefore, specialised profiles that allow for
some basic, real-time and safe tasking abilities need to be created. It would
be great to see more CPUs/Boards with support for the Jorvik and Ravenscar
profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/RREE/AVRAda_Doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AVR-Ada</a></strong> is an embedded development
library that brings support for a large number of AVR devices to the Ada
programming language. You can help by creating more examples, promoting it and
expanding its capabilities.</p>

<p>Ada tends to be shown in a lot of benchmarks, and that should be no surprise, as
it is a highly optimizable, compiled programming language that does not use
garbage collection and leverages some of the best compiler infrastructure in the
world (GCC and LLVM). However, we do not tend to rank at the top. &quot;Why is that?&quot;
one may ask... Well... Most Ada code used for benchmarking purposes has not been
receiving the same amount of effort and care that other programming languages
have. Let&#x27;s fix this!</p>
<p>The following proposals are meant to be undertaken by people familiar with Ada
and HPC (High Performance Computing):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Computer Language Benchmarks
Game</a>:</strong>
Ada programs could be optimised to utilise newer language constructs,
algorithmic design and, once available and if useful, the new Ada 2022
<code>parallel</code> keyword. This should yield better results than the current, already
performant programs. I believe we can improve our times quite a bit!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming Language and Compiler
Benchmarks</a>:</strong> Ada is not
even listed in this competition! The task would require providing performant
Ada examples for this language benchmark comparison.</li>

<p>The proposals here are quite advanced, therefore, they are not recommended for
people unfamiliar with the Ada language.</p>

<li><strong>Mainlining more patches to upstream GNAT:</strong> GNAT/GCC-Ada is a wonderful
piece of technology, and thanks to it being based on the GCC compiler
infrastructure, it can target a large number of Operating Systems and
architectures. However, GNAT/GCC-Ada requires a bit of setup and additional
files that are needed in order to compile Ada code for these targets. The most
common architecture/OS pairs are already present inside GCC, but some
communities maintain their own set of patches in order to support GNAT. It
would be ideal if those patches could become part of the GCC source tree. Here
are some resources and patches that would need mainlining:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://source.android.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a>:</strong> in the past there were some
versions of GNAT that had support for Android and there is still Android
code in the GCC/GNAT source code. However, it has not been tested nor used
in a long while and it seems to have fallen in disrepair. Some patches for
Android support can be found in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajrmarino%2Fdraco%20path%3A%2F%5Emisc%5C%2Fflux13%5C%2F%2F%20android&amp;type=code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this
repository</a>. Nonetheless,
Ada also supports Android with WASM, <a href="https://blog.adacore.com/android-application-with-ada-and-webassembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see this
demo</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenBSD</a></strong> has supported GNAT for a few
architectures for a long while, however, the patches to add support have
never been mainlined. The patches can be found in their ports tree or in
<a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/lang/gcc/11/patches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Github
mirror</a></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://netbsd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetBSD</a>:</strong> updated GCC patches to add support for
NetBSD (amd64) can be found
<a href="https://github.com/jrmarino/draco/tree/master/misc/flux13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Adding
support for other architectures can somewhat easily be done. Thanks to
J. Marino for his work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeBSD</a></strong> support within GNAT could
use quite a bit of help. This is <a href="https://gitlab.com/FreeBSD/freebsd-ports/-/tree/main/lang/gnat12/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the current patch used by
FreeBSD</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adding support for more OSes:</strong> support could be added to the following
&quot;full-fledged&quot; Operating Systems:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://ironclad.cx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ironclad</a></strong> is a POSIX compatible RTOS completely

audience.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zephyr</a></strong> is an RTOS that has been
gaining a lot of traction and support. Initial support for the Zephyr RTOS

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unikernels:</strong> these kernels have been created to run a single application
and be the most secure possible as they have the smallest surface. The Ada
community should ensure that Ada applications can run on these kernels.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://mirage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirage OS</a></strong> is a well-known unikernel written in
OCaml. See also <strong><a href="https://github.com/Solo5/solo5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solo5</a>.</strong> For example,

documentation and create cool demos, see <a href="https://github.com/godunko/adawebpack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Ada-WASM
example</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Bootstrapping GNAT:</strong> GNAT currently requires a previous version to compile
itself. Sadly, there was never an original public version of GNAT that did not
have such requirement. This means, that GNAT cannot be compiled without
already having a working copy of a GNAT installation. The <a href="https://fossil.irvise.xyz/gnat-bootstrap/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GNAT Bootstrapping
project</a> aims to create a
small, minimal compiler together with the <a href="https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live-bootstrap
project</a> in order to build an
initial GNAT compiler.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Scheme and compiler programming knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improve Ada 2022 support in GCC/GNAT:</strong> there are still some Ada 2022
features that are yet to be implemented in GCC/GNAT, mainly the <code>parallel</code>
construct. You can help develop new features, tests them and improve the
current ones. For more information about the implementation of <code>parallel</code> in
