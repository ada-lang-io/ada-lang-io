# UTF-8 encoding in GNAT

Nowadays, UTF-8 is the de facto standard for source code representation.
Section [2.1 Character Set](/docs/arm/AA-2/AA-2.1#implementation-requirements)
of the reference manual says that the compiler must understand texts in UTF-8 encoding:

> An Ada implementation shall accept Ada source code in UTF-8 encoding, with
> or without a BOM (see A.4.11), where every character is represented by its
> code point.

This does not mean that the compiler must do so by default.
In the case of the GNAT compiler, the compiler by default uses the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1)
encoding and a build switch is needed to enable UTF-8 encoding of string literals
and identifiers.

## String literals

For example, the following program has a string literal containing UTF-8 characters:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Main is
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Привіт");
end Main;
```

In some IDEs, such as GNAT Studio, building or even saving the file may
generate an error like:

> This buffer contains UTF-8 characters which could not be translated to ISO-8859-1.
>
> Some data may be missing in the saved file: check the Locations View.
>
> You may change the character set of this file through the "Properties..." contextual menu.

If you change the encoding of the file to UTF-8, the program can be build and may
seem to work as expected (assuming that the terminal understands UTF-8).

:::tip

The default encoding of all files can be changed in GNAT Studio by going to
"Edit" -> "Preferences...". Then go to "General" and change "Character set" to
"Unicode UTF-8". Re-create the file "main.adb" and it will save successfully.

### UTF-8 encoding of string literals

However, from the compiler's point of view the string "Привіт" contains not 6, but 12 characters!
The reason for this is that, according to
Section [3.5.2 Character Types](/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.5#352--character-types)
of the reference manual,
the type `Character` includes only 256 values from the Latin-1 set:

> The predefined type Character is a character type whose values correspond
> to the 256 code points of Row 00 (also known as Latin-1) of the
> ISO/IEC 10646:2017 Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).

As far as the compiler is concerned, the string literal does not contain
any Cyrillic characters.
The compiler sees the string literal as `"Ð_Ñ_Ð¸Ð²ÐµÑ_"` (`_` indicates non-printable characters in Latin-1).
The compiler does not know that you have set the encoding in the IDE
to UTF-8. It still uses Latin-1 as its [default encoding](https://docs.adacore.com/gnat_ugn-docs/html/gnat_ugn/gnat_ugn/the_gnat_compilation_model.html#source-representation).

You can tell the compiler the encoding of the source code is UTF-8 by adding the `-gnatW8` option
to the list of compiler switches.
If your project is an Alire crate, edit the .gpr file in the root of your project and
add `-gnatW8` to the default switches in the package `Compiler`:

```
package Compiler is
   for Default_Switches ("Ada") use Main_Config.Ada_Compiler_Switches & ("-gnatW8");
end Compiler;
```

Now the compiler will see the Cyrillic alphabet and correctly refuses to build
the program:

```
     5.    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Привіт");
                                  |
        >>> literal out of range of type Standard.Character

 6 lines: 1 error
```

:::tip

If your project does not use Alire, the switch can be added in GNAT Studio
as follows: select in the menu "Edit" -> "Project Properties...". Then go to
"Build" -> "Switches" -> "Ada" and write `-gnatW8` in the options bar at the bottom
of the window.

### Printing text containing UTF-8 characters

To work with text containing UTF-8 characters, the type `String` is insufficient.
A different type is needed.

Before the first version of the Ada language, only 127 characters of the ASCII set could fit in
the type `Character`. This was quickly corrected by expanding `Character`
to 256 Latin-1 values. The next version of the standard, around the
time of Java's appearance (whose character size is 16 bits)
introduced the type `Wide_Character`, which contains 65536 characters.
Later the 32-bit type `Wide_Wide_Character` was added for Unicode with its
repertoire of 1114112 "code points".

The types `String` and `Wide_String` were never deprecated.
In fact, the type `String` is still widely used in the standard library.
For example, in file names in packages related to I/O and packages related to
environment variables.

To print the text with the UTF-8 characters in the program above,
the type `Wide_String` should be used instead.
In order to print text of this type, the package `Ada.Wide_Text_IO` is needed:

```ada
with Ada.Wide_Text_IO;

procedure Main is
   Hello : constant Wide_String := "Привіт";
begin
   Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Put_Line (Hello);
end Main;
```

Now the program will compile and print a string of 6 characters to the screen.

## Identifiers

By default the GNAT compiler recognizes only the Latin-1 character set in identifiers.
The current Ada standard, however, defines the
_identifier_ lexical element in Unicode terms, not in Latin-1 characters.
That is, the standard allows the use of non-Latin-1 characters in identifiers.
With `-gnatW8` the compiler will follow the standard with
respect to identifiers and allow the use of UTF-8 characters:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Main is
   π : constant := 3.14;
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (π'Image);
end Main;
```

The use of such names is not particularly encouraged, but can be found useful
in certain cases.

:::caution

Keep compilation units and file names in ASCII to avoid
problems with the compiler and tools.

:::

## When `-gnatW8` isn't allowed

Some style guides prohibit the use of non-ASCII characters in source code.
Without `-gnatW8`,
a `Wide_String` containing UTF-8 characters (in this case "Привіт") can be constructed
as follows:

```ada
with Ada.Wide_Text_IO;

procedure Main is
   Hello : constant Wide_String :=
     Wide_Character'Val (1055) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1088) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1080) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1074) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1110) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1090);
begin
   Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Put_Line (Hello);
end Main;
```

The result is, well, non-obvious:

```text
["041F"]["0440"]["0438"]["0432"]["0456"]["0442"]
```

The output is the so-called "brackets encoding", invented by the GNAT
authors in the early days of `Wide_Character` and `Wide_String`.
To avoid brackets encoding and make the compiler use UTF-8 even without `-gnatW8`,
add `-W8` to the list of switches in package `Binder` in the .gpr file of your project:

```
package Binder is
   for Switches ("ada") use ("-W8");
end Binder;
```

Using this switch, the program will correctly print the string "Привіт" instead
of producing output using brackets encoding.

:::tip

In GNAT Studio, go to the tab "Build" -> "Switches" -> "Binder" and add `-W8` to
the options bar.

:::

:::note

When you use `-gnatW8`, the binder will use the `-W8` switch automatically.
But you can specify both of them, it won't hurt.

:::

:::info

Brackets encoding was used, for example, in GNAT's implementation of package `Ada.Numerics`
to provide the constant `Pi` as the greek letter π:

```ada
["03C0"] : constant := Pi;
```

(Chapter [A.5](/docs/arm/AA-A/AA-A.5#static-semantics) of the reference manual does
not use bracket encoding and uses the actual UTF-8 character π)

## Opening files using UTF-8

Files using UTF-8 can be opened using the parameter `Form => "WCEM=8"`:

```ada
with Ada.Wide_Text_IO;

procedure Main is
   Hello : constant Wide_String :=
     Wide_Character'Val (1055) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1088) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1080) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1074) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1110) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1090);
   Output : Ada.Wide_Text_IO.File_Type;
begin
   Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Create (Output, Name => "hello.txt", Form => "WCEM=8");
   Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Put_Line (Output, Hello);
end Main;
```

## Environment variables

Do not expect your program to pay attention to locale settings (like `LANG`),
but watch out for environment variables
`GNAT_CCS_ENCODING`, `GNAT_CODE_PAGE` on Windows.

## Enabling UTF-8 in other tools

### GNAT programs

Other GNAT programs like `gnatpp` and `gnatstub` can use UTF-8
by using the flag `--wide-character-encoding=8`.

### Ada Language Server

The [Ada Language Server](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server/)
(part of the Ada extension for Visual Studio Code) uses `iso-8859-1` by default.
This can be changed to UTF-8 via the parameter
[defaultCharset](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server/blob/master/doc/settings.md#defaultCharset) in the settings:

```json
"defaultCharset": "UTF-8"
```

## Alire crates for handling Unicode strings

For some time, the Ada standard was unambiguous in that the types `Character` and `String`
could only contain Latin-1 characters. But at some point it faltered under
the onslaught of "lovers of simple solutions" and there appeared functions
to convert `Wide_String`/`Wide_Wide_String` to UTF-8, which use `String`
type instead of an array of bytes to represent UTF-8.

The GNAT authors take full advantage of this, allowing, for example, to pass
to `Ada.Text_IO.Create` the file name in UTF-8 encoding via a parameter of
type `String`.

Introducing the type `Wide_Wide_String` does not really solve the problem of
using Unicode, since this standard does not manipulate "characters", but
combinations of characters. There are variants where several "code points"
form a single glyph when printed or displayed. It is often more convenient for
the user to work in such concepts. This is logical for specifying the
line or column position in a text.
The type `Wide_Wide_String` does not help here.

Various Alire crates exist which provide proper support for Unicode strings:

- [vss](https://github.com/AdaCore/VSS).
  Introduces its own type for Unicode strings with handy methods to work
  with. It can be used to find character boundaries, grapheme clusters, character
  offsets in UTF-8/UTF-16 encoding, etc.

- [matreshka_league](https://alire.ada.dev/crates/matreshka_league). Allows
  you to operate on strings in terms of Unicode "code points". It has a set of
  transcoders to different encoding systems (like Windows-1251, KOI8-R),
  support for JSON, XML, databases, regular expressions, XML template engine,
  etc.
