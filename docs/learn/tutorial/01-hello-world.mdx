# Hello, World!

Welcome to Ada!

Traditionally, the first program written in a new language is ["Hello, World."][hello-world]
This is a simple program just to print a greeting, and help ensure your environment is
set up correctly.

## Requirements

1. **[Alire][alire]** - This program provide simple commands to build and
   run your code, and will install the programs behind this process. The
   detailed controls are still in the background if you need them, but it helps
   streamline the process for developers. You will often find just the main
   Alire interface will work well enough for many projects.

   If you haven't set it up, you can follow the
   [instructions on the Alire site][alire-install].

2. A text editor such as [Visual Studio Code][vs-code] or [Notepad++][notepad++].

## Objectives

1. Make your first running Ada program!
2. Learn how to use standard Ada libraries.

## Starting a new project

`Alire` runs from a command-line terminal. This keeps it slim and allows it
to be easily usable, such as when making automation to build and test large
projects.

:::note

Commands to type in the terminal will follow a `$`, don't type the `$`, that's
just there to indicate this is a command. Commands in tutorials might also have
another block that will show you their output.

:::

`Alire` will generate you a new project. You want to start, or initialize (init),
a new project which runs an executable, which is also called a binary (bin).

```bash
$ alr init --bin my_hello_world
```

You should respond with something like this:

```text
Success: my_hello_world initialized successfully.
```

This made a new directory for your project, `my_hello_world/` with some contents:

```text
my_hello_world/
├── alire.toml
├── my_hello_world.gpr
├── share
│   └── my_hello_world
└── src
└── my_hello_world.adb
```

There's a few files and a few directories that it made.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>alire.toml</code></td>
    <td>Describes what is in your project.</td>
  </tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <code>my_hello_world.gpr</code>
  </td>
  <td>
    <a href="https://docs.adacore.com/gprbuild-docs/html/gprbuild_ug.html">A GNAT project file.</a>
    This is a more detailed file describing how to build your code into a running program or a library
    of code for others to use.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <code>my_hello_world.adb</code>
  </td>
  <td>
    The file with the code executed when your program starts. "adb" is the suffix for the "bodies"
    of Ada files. "adb" files tell the details of what to do, the other type of file, an "ads" file
    by convention, describes how to use what is in an "adb" file.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <code>src/</code>
  </td>
  <td>A directory to place additional code your program needs.</td>
</tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>share/</code></td>
    <td>Used for additional things by Alire.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Building a project

Let's try to build the project:

```bash
$ cd my_hello_world
$ alr build
```

You should see something like:

```text
Note: Synchronizing workspace...
Nothing to update.

Note: Building my_hello_world/my_hello_world.gpr...
Setup
   [mkdir]        object directory for project My_Hello_World
   [mkdir]        exec directory for project My_Hello_World
Compile
   [Ada]          my_hello_world.adb
Bind
   [gprbind]      my_hello_world.bexch
   [Ada]          my_hello_world.ali
Link
   [link]         my_hello_world.adb
Build finished successfully in 1.51 seconds.
```

Let's try to run the program to see what happens:

```bash
$ alr run
```

It prints some things, but it's not very interesting. It doesn't look like it
did anything.

```text
Note: Building my_hello_world/my_hello_world.gpr...
gprbuild: "my_hello_world.exe" up to date
Build finished successfully in 0.70 seconds.
```

## It's just an empty program...

Open up `my_hello_world.adb` and have a look.

```ada
procedure My_Hello_World is
begin
   null;
end My_Hello_World;
```

In most programming languages, the point where the program begins (the entry point)
is called "main" but in Ada it can have other names. This is something
configured in the `my_hello_world.gpr` file made when Alire created the project.

This is just an empty program. Broken down, it here's what the various words
mean:

`procedure` - What follows is a block of code that can be run by giving its name.

`My_Hello_World` - This "identifies" the procedure uniquely in this part of the
program. Since it provides identification, it's called an **"identifier."**

`is` ... `begin` - Between these two words is the section of code is where
additional variables and constants would go. There' no variables or constants
used here, so it's just empty.

`begin` ... `end` - Instructions called "statements" go between these words to
tell the program to do things. They are executed one at a time, and each one
is separated by semicolon `;`.

`null;` - The section between `begin` and `end` cannot be empty, so it **MUST**
have a statement. The "null statement" does nothing.

`end My_Hello_World;` - Indicates the end of the program. In Ada, `end`s can be
annotated the name of the thing which started the block being terminated. In
this case, it's the procedure `My_Hello_World`, so that's the name used here.

## Making it do something

There's an empty program, with absolutely nothing in it. How do you make it
do something?

The start of every Ada file is what is called the "context clause." This is
where dependencies on other pieces of code get put. In Ada, there are three
packages provided as part of the language, though with `Alire` you can easily bring
in additional code from other libraries, but these are the big three:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Ada</code></td><td>Data structures, basic facilities to read/write files, etc.</td>
  </tr>

{" "}

<tr>
  <td>
    <code>Standard</code>
  </td>
  <td>
    The built-in library of extremely basic things to build upon. These are often things the
    language must handle specially that can't be built out of other things.
  </td>
</tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>Interfaces</code></td><td>Components to talk to other languages, like C.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These "packages" of code can be nested. You want to print things, which is in
the `Text_IO` package, which resides within the `Ada` package. A period (full stop)
between names indicates that the thing on the right is contained within the thing
on the left.

You want to use procedure to print text to the console, so you bring in `Ada.Text_IO`
as a dependency:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure My_Hello_World is
begin
   null;
end My_Hello_World;
```

There's something to do now, so replace that `null` statement with a greeting
to the world. `Put_Line` is a procedure within the `Ada.Text_IO` package, so
place a period after that name to indicate that's where the procedure is located.
`Put_Line` accepts an input, so use parentheses `(` and `)` around your greeting
of `"Hello, World!"`.

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure My_Hello_World is
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Hello, World!");
end My_Hello_World;
```

Let's run the program again. You don't need to do `alr build` every time, if
you've change your program code, you can use `alr run` and it will build your
code if it changed automatically before running your program.

```bash
$ alr run
```

```text
Note: Building my_hello_world/my_hello_world.gpr...
Compile
   [Ada]          my_hello_world.adb
Bind
   [gprbind]      my_hello_world.bexch
   [Ada]          my_hello_world.ali
Link
   [link]         my_hello_world.adb
Build finished successfully in 1.03 seconds.
Hello, World!
```

And there's your greeting to the world!
