# Tasks

## Timing out on a Blocking Operation

```ada
task body My_Task is
    Elem : A_Queue_Element;
begin
    loop -- processing loop
        select
            A_Queue.Blocking_Queue (Elem);
        or
            -- Stop processing after a 1 second timeout. Removing this delay causes
            -- immediate exit if a block occurs.
            delay 1.0;
            exit;
        end select;

        -- ... process Elem ...
    end loop
end My_Task;
```

## Waiting for all tasks to complete

A list of statements doesn't exit until all tasks are complete, so by using
`declare ... begin ... end` you can wait until all your tasks are done.

```ada
declare
    A_Task : My_Task;  -- task which needs to finish before more processing
begin
    null; -- Just wait until the task is done.
end;

-- Continue other operations here.
```
