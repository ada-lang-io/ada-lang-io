# Alire

By far the easiest way to get hold of a Mac toolchain is to use the Ada package manager [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/docs/#introduction).

The Alire website's [Releases page](https://github.com/alire-project/alire/releases) provides Intel builds:

- the current stable build, [v1.2.2](https://github.com/alire-project/alire/releases/tag/v1.2.2),
- the draft [v2.0.0 beta 1](https://github.com/alire-project/alire/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta1) release,
- a [nightly build](https://github.com/alire-project/alire/releases/tag/nightly).

Any of these can be installed as described [here](https://alire.ada.dev/docs/#alr-on-macos); follow up with these [first steps](https://alire.ada.dev/docs/#first-steps) (this will have the added effect of installing a toolchain for you!)
