### Dynamic Arrays

#### guideline

- Use constrained arrays when measured performance indicates.

#### rationale

If array bounds are not known until run-time, then calculations of these
bounds may affect run-time performance. Using named constants or static
expressions as array bounds may provide better performance than using
variables or nonstatic expressions. Thus, if the values of Lower and
Upper are not determined until run-time, then:

... is array (Lower .. Upper) of ...

may cause address and offset calculations to be delayed until run-time,
introducing a performance penalty. See NASA (1992) for a detailed
discussion of the tradeoffs and alternatives.

### Zero-Based Arrays

#### guideline

- Use zero-based indexing for arrays when measured performance
  indicates.

#### rationale

For some compilers, offset calculations for an array whose lower bound
is 0 (either the integer zero or the first value of an enumeration type)
are simplified. For other compilers, optimization is more likely if the
lower bound is 1.

### Unconstrained Records

#### guideline

- Use fixed-size components for records when measured performance
  indicates.

#### example

```ada
subtype Line_Range   is Integer range 0 .. Max_Lines;
subtype Length_Range is Integer range 0 .. Max_Length;

-- Note that Max_Lines and Max_Length need to be static
type Paragraph_Body is array (Line_Range range <>, Length_Range range <>) of Character;

type Paragraph (Lines : Line_Range := 0; Line_Length : Length_Range := 0) is
   record
      Text : Paragraph_Body (1 .. Lines, 1 .. Line_Length);
   end record;
```

#### rationale

Determine the size and speed impact of unconstrained records having
components depending on discriminants. Some compilers will allocate the
maximum possible size to each object of the type; others will use
pointers to the dependent components, incurring a possible heap
performance penalty. Consider the possibility of using fixed-size
components.

### Records and Arrays

#### guideline

- Define arrays of records as parallel arrays when measured
  performance indicates.

#### example

```ada
    -- Array of records
    Process (Student (Index).Name, Student (Index).Grade);
    -- Record of arrays
    Process (Student.Name (Index), Student.Grade (Index));
    -- Parallel arrays
    Process (Name (Index), Grade (Index));
```

#### rationale

Determine the impact of structuring data as arrays of records, records
containing arrays, or parallel arrays. Some implementations of Ada will
show significant performance differences among these examples.

### Record and Array Aggregates

#### guideline

- Use a sequence of assignments for an aggregation when measured
  performance indicates.

#### rationale

Determine the impact of using an aggregate versus a sequence of
assignments. Using an aggregate generally requires the use of a
temporary variable. If the aggregate is "static" (i.e., its size and
components are known at compile- or link-time, allowing link-time
allocation and initialization), then it will generally be more efficient
than a sequence of assignments. If the aggregate is "dynamic," then a
series of assignments may be more efficient because no temporary
variable is needed.

See Guideline 5.6.10 for a discussion of aggregates from the point of
view of readability and maintainability.

See Guideline 10.6.1 for a discussion of extension aggregates.
