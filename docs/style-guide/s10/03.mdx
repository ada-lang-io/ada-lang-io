### Blocks

#### guideline

- Use blocks (see Guideline 5.6.9) to introduce late initialization
  when measured performance indicates.

#### example

```ada
   ...
   Initial : Matrix;

begin  -- Find_Solution

   Initialize_Solution_Matrix:
      for Row in Initial'Range(1) loop
         for Col in Initial'Range(2) loop
            Initial (Row, Col) := Get_Value (Row, Col);
         end loop;
      end loop Initialize_Solution_Matrix;

   Converge_To_The_Solution:
      declare

         Solution       : Matrix           := Identity;
         Min_Iterations : constant Natural := ...;

      begin  -- Converge_To_The_Solution
         for Iterations in 1 .. Min_Iterations loop
            Converge (Solution, Initial);
         end loop;

      end Converge_To_The_Solution;

   ...
end Find_Solution;
```

#### rationale

Late initialization allows a compiler more choices in register usage
optimization. Depending on the circumstance, this may introduce a
significant performance improvement.

Some compilers incur a performance penalty when declarative blocks are
introduced. Careful analysis and timing tests by the programmer may
identify those declarative blocks that should be removed.

#### notes

It is difficult to accurately predict through code inspections which
declarative blocks improve performance and which degrade performance.
However, with these general guidelines and a familiarity with the
particular implementation, performance can be improved.
