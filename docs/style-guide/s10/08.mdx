title: 10.8 Summary
---

- Use the guidelines in this chapter with care; they may be hazardous
  to your software.

#### program structure

- Use blocks to introduce late initialization when measured
  performance indicates .

### data structures

- Use constrained arrays when measured performance indicates.
- Use zero-based indexing for arrays when measured performance
  indicates.
- Use fixed-size components for records when measured performance
  indicates.
- Define arrays of records as parallel arrays when measured
  performance indicates.
- Use a sequence of assignments for an aggregation when measured
  performance indicates.

### algorithms

- Use incremental schemes instead of mod and rem when measured
  performance indicates.
- Use the short-circuit control form when measured performance
  indicates.
- Use the case statement when measured performance indicates.
- Use hard-coded constraint checking when measured performance
  indicates.
- Use column-first processing of two-dimensional arrays when measured
  performance indicates.
- Use overwriting for conditional assignment when measured performance
  indicates.
- When measured performance indicates, perform packed Boolean array
  shift operations by using slice assignments rather than repeated
  bit-wise assignment.
- Use static subprogram dispatching when measured performance
  indicates.\<

### types

- Use only simple aggregates when measured performance indicates.
- For mutual exclusion, when measured performance indicates, use
  protected types as an alternative to tasking rendezvous.
- To implement an interrupt handler, when measured performance
  indicates, use a protected procedure.
- Use modular types rather than packed Boolean arrays when measured
  performance indicates.
- Use the predefined bounded strings when predictable performance is
  an issue and measured performance indicates.
- Use the procedural form of the string handling subprograms when
  measured performance indicates.
- Use strong typing with carefully selected constraints to reduce
  run-time constraint checking when measured performance indicates.
- For cases where both rendezvous and protected types are inefficient,
  consider the use of the Real-Time Systems Annex (Ada Reference
  Manual 1995, Annex D).

### pragmas

- When measured performance indicates, use pragma Inline when calling
  overhead is a significant portion of the routine's execution time.
- Use pragma Restrictions to express the user's intent to abide by
  certain restrictions.
- Use pragma Preelaborate where allowed.
- Use pragma Pure where allowed.
- Use pragma Discard_Names when the names are not needed by the
  application and data space is at a premium.
- Use pragma Suppress where necessary to achieve performance
  requirements.
- Use pragma Reviewable to aid in the analysis of the generated code.
