title: 10.7 Pragmas
---

### Pragma Inline

#### guideline

- When measured performance indicates, use pragma Inline when calling
  overhead is a significant portion of the routine's execution time.

#### example

```ada
procedure Assign (Variable : in out Integer;
                  Value    : in     Integer);
pragma Inline (Assign);
...
procedure Assign (Variable : in out Integer;
                  Value    : in     Integer) is
begin
   Variable := Value;
end Assign;
```

#### rationale

If calling overhead is a significant portion of a subprogram's execution
time, then using pragma Inline may reduce execution time.

Procedure and function invocations include overhead that is unnecessary
when the code involved is very small. These small routines are usually
written to maintain the implementation hiding characteristics of a
package. They may also simply pass their parameters unchanged to another
routine. When one of these routines appears in some code that needs to
run faster, either the implementation-hiding principle needs to be
violated or a pragma Inline can be introduced.

The use of pragma Inline does have its disadvantages. It can create
compilation dependencies on the body; that is, when the specification
uses a pragma Inline, both the specification and corresponding body may
need to be compiled before the specification can be used. As updates are
made to the code, a routine may become more complex (larger) and the
continued use of a pragma Inline may no longer be justified.

#### exceptions

Although it is rare, inlining code may increase code size, which can
lead to slower performance caused by additional paging. A pragma Inline
may actually thwart a compiler's attempt to use some other optimization
technique, such as register optimization.

When a compiler is already doing a good job of selecting routines to be
inlined, the pragma may accomplish little, if any, improvement in
execution speed.

### Pragma Restrictions

#### guideline

- Use pragma Restrictions to express the user's intent to abide by
  certain restrictions.

#### rationale

This may facilitate the construction of simpler run-time environments
(Ada Reference Manual 1995, [§13.12](../../arm/AA-13/AA-13.12.mdx),
[§D.7](../../arm/AA-D/AA-D.7.mdx), and [§H.4](../../arm/AA-H/AA-H.4.mdx)).

### Pragma Preelaborate

#### guideline

- Use pragma Preelaborate where allowed.

#### rationale

This may reduce memory write operations after load time (Ada Reference
Manual 1995, [§10.2.1](../../arm/AA-10/AA-10.2.mdx#Subclause_10.2.1) and
[§C.4](../../arm/AA-C/AA-C.4.mdx)).

### Pragma Pure

#### guideline

- Use pragma Pure where allowed.

#### rationale

This may permit the compiler to omit calls on library-level subprograms
of the library unit if the results are not needed after the call ([Ada
Reference Manual, §10.2.1](../../arm/AA-10/AA-10.2.mdx#Subclause_10.2.1)).

### Pragma Discard_Names

#### guideline

- Use pragma Discard_Names when the names are not needed by the
  application and data space is at a premium.

#### rationale

This may reduce the memory needed to store names of Ada entities, where
no operation uses those names ([Ada Reference Manual,
§C.5](../../arm/AA-C/AA-C.5.mdx)).

### Pragma Suppress

#### guideline

- Use pragma Suppress where necessary to achieve performance
  requirements.

#### rationale

See Guideline 5.9.5.

### Pragma Reviewable

#### guideline

- Use pragma Reviewable to aid in the analysis of the generated code.

#### rationale

See the Ada Reference Manual (([§H](../../arm/AA-H/AA-H.mdx)).
