The physical layout of source text on the page or screen has a strong
effect on its readability. This chapter contains source code
presentation guidelines intended to make the code more readable.

In addition to the general purpose guidelines, specific recommendations
are made in the "instantiation" sections. If you disagree with the
specific recommendations, you may want to adopt your own set of
conventions that still follow the general purpose guidelines. Above all,
be consistent across your entire project.

An entirely consistent layout is hard to achieve or check manually.
Therefore, you may prefer to automate layout with a tool for
parameterized code formatting or incorporate the guidelines into an
automatic coding template. Some of the guidelines and specific
recommendations presented in this chapter cannot be enforced by a
formatting tool because they are based on the semantics, not the syntax,
of the Ada code. More details are given in the "automation notes"
sections.

## Code Formatting

The "code formatting" of Ada source code affects how the code looks, not
what the code does. Topics included here are horizontal spacing,
indentation, alignment, pagination, and line length. The most important
guideline is to be consistent throughout the compilation unit as well as
the project.

### Horizontal Spacing

#### guideline

  - Use consistent spacing around delimiters.
  - Use the same spacing as you would in regular prose.

#### instantiation

Specifically, leave at least one blank space in the following places, as
shown in the examples throughout this book. More spaces may be required
for the vertical alignment recommended in subsequent guidelines.

  - Before and after the following delimiters and binary operators:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
  + - * / &
  < = > /= <= >=
  := => | ..
  :
  <> 
```

  - Outside of the quotes for string (") and character (' ) literals,
    except where prohibited.
  - Outside, but not inside, parentheses.
  - After commas (,) and semicolons (;).

Do not leave any blank spaces in the following places, even if this
conflicts with the above recommendations.

  - After the plus (+) and minus (-) signs when used as unary operators.
  - After a function call.
  - Inside of label delimiters (\<\< \>\>).
  - Before and after the exponentiation operator (\*\*), apostrophe ('),
    and period (.)
  - Between multiple consecutive opening or closing parentheses.
  - Before commas (,) and semicolons (;).

When superfluous parentheses are omitted because of operator precedence
rules, spaces may optionally be removed around the highest precedence
operators in that expression.

#### example

``` ada
Default_String : constant String :=
      "This is the long string returned by" &
      " default. It is broken into multiple" &
      " Ada source lines for convenience.";

type Signed_Whole_16 is range -2**15 .. 2**15 - 1;
type Address_Area  is array (Natural range <>) of Signed_Whole_16;

Register : Address_Area (16#7FF0# .. 16#7FFF#);
Memory   : Address_Area (       0 .. 16#7FEC#);

Register (Pc) := Register (A);

X := Signed_Whole_16 (Radius * Sin (Angle));

Register (Index) := Memory (Base_Address + Index * Element_Length);

Get (Value => Sensor);

Error_Term := 1.0 - (Cos (Theta)**2 + Sin (Theta)**2);

Z      := X**3;
Y      := C * X + B;
Volume := Length * Width * Height;
```

#### rationale

It is a good idea to use white space around delimiters and operators
because they are typically short sequences (one or two characters) that
can easily get lost among the longer keywords and identifiers. Putting
white space around them makes them stand out. Consistency in spacing
also helps make the source code easier to scan visually.

However, many of the delimiters (commas, semicolons, parentheses, etc.)
are familiar as normal punctuation marks. It is distracting to see them
spaced differently in a computer program than in normal text. Therefore,
use the same spacing as in text (no spaces before commas and semicolons,
no spaces inside parentheses, etc.).

#### exceptions

The one notable exception is the colon (:). In Ada, it is useful to use
the colon as a tabulator or a column separator (see Guideline 2.1.4). In
this context, it makes sense to put spaces before and after the colon
rather than only after it as in normal text.

#### automation notes

The guidelines in this section are easily enforced with an automatic
code formatter.

### Indentation

#### guideline

  - Indent and align nested control structures, continuation lines, and
    embedded units consistently.
  - Distinguish between indentation for nested control structures and
    for continuation lines.
  - Use spaces for indentation, not the tab character (Nissen and Wallis
    1984, ยง2.2).

#### instantiation

Specifically, the following indentation conventions are recommended, as
shown in the examples throughout this book. Note that the minimum
indentation is described. More spaces may be required for the vertical
alignment recommended in subsequent guidelines.

  - Use the recommended paragraphing shown in the Ada Reference Manual
    (1995).
  - Use three spaces as the basic unit of indentation for nesting.
  - Use two spaces as the basic unit of indentation for continuation
    lines.

A label is outdented three spaces:

``` ada
begin
<<label>>
   <statement>
end;
```

``` ada
<long statement with line break>
  <trailing part of same statement>
```

The if statement and the plain loop:

``` ada
if <condition> then
   <statements>
elsif <condition> then
   <statements>
else
   <statements>
end if;
```

``` ada
<name>:
loop
   <statements>
   exit when <condition>;
   <statements>
end loop <name>;
```

Loops with the for and while iteration schemes:

``` ada
<name>:
   for <scheme> loop
      <statements>
   end loop <name>;
```

``` ada
<name>:
   while <condition> loop
      <statements>
   end loop <name>;
```

The block and the case statement as recommended in the Ada Reference
Manual (1995):

``` ada
<name>:
   declare
      <declarations>
   begin
      <statements>
   exception
      when <choice> =>
         <statements>
      when others =>
         <statements>
   end <name>;
```

``` ada
case <expression> is
   when <choice> =>
      <statements>
   when <choice> =>
      <statements>
   when others =>
      <statements>
end case;  --<comment>
```

These case statements save space over the Ada Reference Manual (1995)
recommendation and depend on very short statement lists, respectively.
Whichever you choose, be consistent:

``` ada
case <expression> is
when <choice> =>
     <statements>
when <choice> =>
     <statements>
when others =>
     <statements>
end case;
```

``` ada
case <expression> is
   when <choice> => <statements>
                    <statements>
   when <choice> => <statements>
   when others   => <statements>
end case;
```

The various forms of selective accept and the timed and conditional
entry calls:

``` ada
select
   when <guard> =>
      <accept statement>
      <statements>
or
   <accept statement>
   <statements>
or
   when <guard> =>
      delay <interval>;
      <statements>
or
   when <guard> =>
      terminate;
else
   <statements>
end select;
```

``` ada
select
   <entry call>;
   <statements>
or
   delay <interval>;
   <statements>
end select;

select
   <entry call>;
   <statements>
else
   <statements>
end select;

select
   <triggering alternative>
then abort
   <abortable part>
end select;
```

The accept statement:

``` ada
accept <specification> do
   <statements>
end <name>;
```

``` ada
separate (<parent unit>)
<proper body>
```

A subunit:

``` ada
separate (<parent unit>)
<proper body>
end <name>;
```

Proper bodies of program units:

``` ada
procedure <specification> is
   <declarations>
begin
   <statements>
exception
   when <choice> =>
      <statements>
end <name>;

function <specification>
  return <type name> is
   <declarations>
begin
   <statements>
exception
   when <choice> =>
      <statements>
end <name>;
```

``` ada
package body <name> is
   <declarations>
begin
   <statements>
exception
   when <choice>=>
      <statements>
end <name>;

task body <name> is
   <declarations>
begin
   <statements>
exception
   when <choice>=>
      <statements>
end <name>;
```

Context clauses on compilation units are arranged as a table. Generic
formal parameters do not obscure the unit itself. Function, package, and
task specifications use standard indentation:

``` ada
with <name>; use <name>;
with <name>;
with <name>;

<compilation unit>

generic
   <formal parameters>
<compilation unit>
```

``` ada
function <specification>
  return <type>;

package <name> is
   <declarations>
private
   <declarations>
end <name>;

task type <name> is
   <entry declarations>
end <name>;
```

Instantiations of generic units and record indentation:

``` ada
procedure <name> is
   new <generic name> <actuals>

function <name> is
   new <generic name> <actuals>

package <name> is
   new <generic name> <actuals>
```

``` ada
type ... is
   record
      <component list>
      case <discriminant name> is
         when <choice> =>
            <component list>
         when <choice> =>
            <component list>
      end case;
   end record;
```

Indentation for record alignment:

``` ada
for <name> use
   record <mod clause>
      <component clause>
   end record;
```

Tagged types and type extension:

``` ada
type ... is tagged
   record
      <component list>
   end record;

type ... is new ... with
   record
      <component list>
   end record;
```

#### example

``` ada
Default_String : constant String :=
      "This is the long string returned by" &
      " default.  It is broken into multiple" &
      " Ada source lines for convenience.";

...

   if Input_Found then
      Count_Characters;

   else  --not Input_Found
      Reset_State;
      Character_Total :=
        First_Part_Total  * First_Part_Scale_Factor  +
        Second_Part_Total * Second_Part_Scale_Factor +
        Default_String'Length + Delimiter_Size;
   end if;

end loop;
```

#### rationale

Indentation improves the readability of the code because it gives you a
visual indicator of the program structure. The levels of nesting are
clearly identified by indentation, and the first and last keywords in a
construct can be matched visually.

While there is much discussion on the number of spaces to indent, the
reason for indentation is code clarity. The fact that the code is
indented consistently is more important than the number of spaces used
for indentation.

Additionally, the Ada Reference Manual (1995, ยง1.1.4) states that the
layout shown in the examples and syntax rules in the manual is the
recommended code layout to be used for Ada programs: "The syntax rules
describing structured constructs are presented in a form that
corresponds to the recommended paragraphing . . . . Different lines are
used for parts of a syntax rule if the corresponding parts of the
construct described by the rule are intended to be on different lines .
. . . It is recommended that all indentation be by multiples of a basic
step of indentation (the number of spaces for the basic step is not
defined)."

It is important to indent continuation lines differently from nested
control structures to make them visually distinct. This prevents them
from obscuring the structure of the code as you scan it.

Listing context clauses on individual lines allows easier maintenance;
changing a context clause is less error-prone.

Indenting with spaces is more portable than indenting with tabs because
tab characters are displayed differently by different terminals and
printers.

#### exceptions

If you are using a variable width font, tabs will align better than
spaces. However, depending on your tab setting, lines of successive
indentation may leave you with a very short line length.

#### automation notes

The guidelines in this section are easily enforced with an automatic
code formatter.

### Alignment of Operators

#### guideline

  - Align operators vertically to emphasize local program structure and
    semantics.

#### example

``` ada
    if Slot_A >= Slot_B then
       Temporary := Slot_A;
       Slot_A    := Slot_B;
       Slot_B    := Temporary;
    end if;

    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    Numerator   := B**2 - 4.0 * A * C;
    Denominator := 2.0 * A;
    Solution_1 := (B + Square_Root(Numerator)) / Denominator;
    Solution_2 := (B - Square_Root(Numerator)) / Denominator;
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    X := A * B +
         C * D +
         E * F;

    Y := (A * B + C) +  (2.0 * D - E) -  -- basic equation
         3.5;                            -- account for error factor
```

#### rationale

Alignment makes it easier to see the position of the operators and,
therefore, puts visual emphasis on what the code is doing.

The use of lines and spacing on long expressions can emphasize terms,
precedence of operators, and other semantics. It can also leave room for
highlighting comments within an expression.

#### exceptions

If vertical alignment of operators forces a statement to be broken over
two lines, especially if the break is at an inappropriate spot, it may
be preferable to relax the alignment guideline.

#### automation notes

The last example above shows a kind of "semantic alignment" that is not
typically enforced or even preserved by automatic code formatters. If
you break expressions into semantic parts and put each on a separate
line, beware of using a code formatter later. It is likely to move the
entire expression to a single line and accumulate all the comments at
the end. However, there are some formatters that are intelligent enough
to leave a line break intact when the line contains a comment. A good
formatter will recognize that the last example above does not violate
the guidelines and would, therefore, preserve it as written.

### Alignment of Declarations

#### guideline

  - Use vertical alignment to enhance the readability of declarations.
  - Provide, at most, one declaration per line.
  - Indent all declarations in a single declarative part at the same
    level.

#### instantiation

For declarations not separated by blank lines, follow these alignment
rules:

  - Align the colon delimiters.
  - Align the := initialization delimiter.
  - When trailing comments are used, align the comment delimiter.
  - When the declaration overflows a line, break the line and add an
    indentation level for those lines that wrap. The preferred places to
    break, in order, are: (1) the comment delimiter; (2) the
    initialization delimiter; (3) the colon delimiter.
  - For enumeration type declarations that do not fit on a single line,
    put each literal on a separate line, using the next level of
    indentation. When appropriate, semantically related literals can be
    arranged by row or column to form a table.

#### example

Variable and constant declarations can be laid out in a tabular format
with columns separated by the symbols :, :=, and --

``` ada
    Prompt_Column : constant        := 40;
    Question_Mark : constant String := " ? "; -- prompt on error input
    Prompt_String : constant String := " ==> ";
```

If this results in lines that are too long, they can be laid out with
each part on a separate line with its unique indentation level:

``` ada
    subtype User_Response_Text_Frame is String (1 .. 72);
    -- If the declaration needed a comment, it would fit here.
    Input_Line_Buffer : User_Response_Text_Frame
           := Prompt_String &
              String'(1 .. User_Response_Text_Frame'Length -
                           Prompt_String'Length => ' ');
```

Declarations of enumeration literals can be listed in one or more
columns as:

``` ada
  type Op_Codes_In_Column is
        (Push,
         Pop,
         Add,
         Subtract,
         Multiply,
         Divide,
         Subroutine_Call,
         Subroutine_Return,
         Branch,
         Branch_On_Zero,
         Branch_On_Negative);
```

or, to save space:

``` ada
    type Op_Codes_Multiple_Columns is
          (Push,            Pop,                Add,
           Subtract,        Multiply,           Divide,
           Subroutine_Call, Subroutine_Return,  Branch,
           Branch_On_Zero,  Branch_On_Negative);
```

or, to emphasize related groups of values:

``` ada
    type Op_Codes_In_Table is
          (Push,            Pop,
           Add,             Subtract,          Multiply,    Divide,
           Subroutine_Call, Subroutine_Return,
           Branch,          Branch_On_Zero,    Branch_On_Negative);
```

#### rationale

Many programming standards documents require tabular repetition of
names, types, initial values, and meaning in unit header comments. These
comments are redundant and can become inconsistent with the code.
Aligning the declarations themselves in tabular fashion (see the
examples above) provides identical information to both compiler and
reader; enforces, at most, one declaration per line; and eases
maintenance by providing space for initializations and necessary
comments. A tabular layout enhances readability, thus preventing names
from "hiding" in a mass of declarations. This applies to all
declarations: types, subtypes, objects, exceptions, named numbers, and
so forth.

#### automation notes

Most of the guidelines in this section are easily enforced with an
automatic code formatter. The one exception is the last enumerated type
example, which is laid out in rows based on the semantics of the
enumeration literals. An automatic code formatter will not be able to do
this and will likely move the enumeration literals to different lines.
However, tools that are checking only for violations of the guidelines
should accept the tabular form of an enumeration type declaration.

### More on Alignment

#### guideline

  - Align parameter modes and parentheses vertically.

#### instantiation

Specifically, it is recommended that you:

  - Place one formal parameter specification per line.
  - Vertically align parameter names, colons, the reserved word in, the
    reserved word out, and parameter subtypes.
  - Place the first parameter specification on the same line as the
    subprogram or entry name. If any parameter subtypes are forced
    beyond the line length limit, place the first parameter
    specification on a new line indented the same as a continuation
    line.

#### example

``` ada
    procedure Display_Menu (Title   : in     String;
                            Options : in     Menus;
                            Choice  :    out Alpha_Numerics);
```

The following two examples show alternate instantiations of this
guideline:

``` ada
    procedure Display_Menu_On_Primary_Window
          (Title   : in     String;
           Options : in     Menus;
           Choice  :    out Alpha_Numerics); 
```

or:

``` ada
    procedure Display_Menu_On_Screen (
          Title   : in     String;
          Options : in     Menus;
          Choice  :    out Alpha_Numerics
        );
```

Aligning parentheses makes complicated relational expressions more
clear:

``` ada
    if not (First_Character in Alpha_Numerics and then
            Valid_Option(First_Character))        then
```

#### rationale

This alignment facilitates readability and understandability, and it is
easy to achieve given automated support. Aligning parameter modes
provides the effect of a table with columns for parameter name, mode,
subtype, and, if necessary, parameter-specific comments. Vertical
alignment of parameters across subprograms within a compilation unit
increases the readability even more.

#### notes

Various options are available for subprogram layout. The second example
above aligns all of the subprogram names and parameter names in a
program. This has the disadvantage of occupying an unnecessary line
where subprogram names are short and looking awkward if there is only
one parameter.

The third example is a format commonly used to reduce the amount of
editing required when parameter lines are added, deleted, or reordered.
The parentheses do not have to be moved from line to line. However, the
last parameter line is the only one without a semicolon.

#### exceptions

When an operator function has two or more formal parameters of the same
type, it is more readable to declare the parameters in a single one-line
list rather than to separate the formal parameter list into multiple
formal parameter specifications.

``` ada
    type Color_Scheme is (Red, Purple, Blue, Green, Yellow, White, Black, Brown, Gray, Pink);

    function "&" (Left, Right : Color_Scheme) return Color_Scheme;
```

#### automation notes

Most of the guidelines in this section are easily enforced with an
automatic code formatter. The one exception is the last example, which
shows vertical alignment of parentheses to emphasize terms of an
expression. This is difficult to achieve with an automatic code
formatter unless the relevant terms of the expression can be determined
strictly through operator precedence.

### Blank Lines

#### guideline

  - Use blank lines to group logically related lines of text (NASA
    1987).

#### example

``` ada
    if ... then

       for ... loop
          ...
       end loop;

    end if;
```

This example separates different kinds of declarations with blank lines:

``` ada
    type Employee_Record is
       record
          Legal_Name    : Name;
          Date_Of_Birth : Date;
          Date_Of_Hire  : Date;
          Salary        : Money;
       end record;

    type Day is
          (Monday,    Tuesday,   Wednesday, Thursday,  Friday,
           Saturday,  Sunday);

    subtype Weekday is Day range Monday   .. Friday;
    subtype Weekend is Day range Saturday .. Sunday;
```

#### rationale

When blank lines are used in a thoughtful and consistent manner,
sections of related code are more visible to readers.

#### automation notes

Automatic formatters do not enforce this guideline well because the
decision on where to insert blank lines is a semantic one. However, many
formatters have the ability to leave existing blank lines intact. Thus,
you can manually insert the lines and not lose the effect when you run
such a formatter.

### Pagination

#### guideline

  - Highlight the top of each package or task specification, the top of
    each program unit body, and the end statement of each program unit.

#### instantiation

Specifically, it is recommended that you:

  - Use file prologues, specification headers, and body headers to
    highlight those structures as recommended in Guideline 3.3.
  - Use a line of dashes, beginning at the same column as the current
    indentation to highlight the definition of nested units embedded in
    a declarative part. Insert the line of dashes immediately before and
    immediately after the definition.
  - If two dashed lines are adjacent, omit the longer of the two.

#### example

``` ada
    with Basic_Types;
    package body SPC_Numeric_Types is
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------
       function Max
             (Left  : in     Basic_Types.Tiny_Integer;
              Right : in     Basic_Types.Tiny_Integer)
             return Basic_Types.Tiny_Integer is
       begin
          if Right < Left then
             return Left;
          else
             return Right;
          end if;
       end Max;
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------
       function Min
             (Left  : in     Basic_Types.Tiny_Integer;
              Right : in     Basic_Types.Tiny_Integer)
             return Basic_Types.Tiny_Integer is
       begin
          if Left < Right then
             return Left;
          else
             return Right;
          end if;
       end Min;
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------
       use Basic_Types;
    begin  -- SPC_Numeric_Types
       Max_Tiny_Integer := Min(System_Max, Local_Max);
       Min_Tiny_Integer := Max(System_Min, Local_Min);
       -- ...
    end SPC_Numeric_Types;
```

#### rationale

It is easy to overlook parts of program units that are not visible on
the current page or screen. The page lengths of presentation hardware
and software vary widely. By clearly marking the program's logical page
boundaries (e.g., with a dashed line), you enable a reader to quickly
check whether all of a program unit is visible. Such pagination also
makes it easier to scan a large file quickly, looking for a particular
program unit.

#### exceptions

This guideline does not address code layout on the physical "page"
because the dimensions of such pages vary widely and no single guideline
is appropriate.

#### automation notes

The guidelines in this section are easily enforced with an automatic
code formatter.

### Number of Statements Per Line

#### guideline

  - Start each statement on a new line.
  - Write no more than one simple statement per line.
  - Break compound statements over multiple lines.

#### example

Use:

``` ada
    if End_Of_File then
       Close_File;
    else
       Get_Next_Record;
    end if;
```

rather than:

``` ada
    if End_Of_File then Close_File; else Get_Next_Record; end if;
```

exceptional case:

``` ada
    Put("A=");    Natural_IO.Put(A);    New_Line;
    Put("B=");    Natural_IO.Put(B);    New_Line;
    Put("C=");    Natural_IO.Put(C);    New_Line;
```

#### rationale

A single statement on each line enhances the reader's ability to find
statements and helps prevent statements being missed. Similarly, the
structure of a compound statement is clearer when its parts are on
separate lines.

#### exceptions

If a statement is longer than the remaining space on the line, continue
it on the next line. This guideline includes declarations, context
clauses, and subprogram parameters.

According to the Ada Reference Manual (1995, ยง1.1.4), "The preferred
places for other line breaks are after semicolons."

#### automation notes

The guidelines in this section are easily enforced with an automatic
code formatter, with the single exception of the last example, which
shows a semantic grouping of multiple statements onto a single line.

#### exceptions

The example of Put and New\_Line statements shows a legitimate
exception. This grouping of closely related statements on the same line
makes the structural relationship between the groups clear.

### Source Code Line Length

#### guideline

  - Adhere to a maximum line length limit for source code (Nissen and
    Wallis 1984, ยง2.3).

#### instantiation

Specifically, it is recommended that you:

  - Limit source code line lengths to a maximum of 72 characters.

#### rationale

When Ada code is ported from one system to another, there may be
restrictions on the record size of source line statements, possibly for
one of the following reasons: some operating systems may not support
variable length records for tape I/O, or some printers and terminals
support an 80-character line width with no line-wrap. See further
rationale in the note for Guideline 7.1.2.

Source code must sometimes be published for various reasons, and
letter-size paper is not as forgiving as a computer listing in terms of
the number of usable columns.

In addition, there are human limitations in the width of the field of
view for understanding at the level required for reading source code.
These limitations correspond roughly to the 70- to 80-column range.

#### exceptions

An alternate instantiation is to limit source code length to 79
characters. The 79-character limit differentiates the code from the
FORTRAN 72-character limit. It also avoids problems with 80-character
width terminals where the character in the last column may not print
correctly.

#### automation notes

The guidelines in this section are easily enforced with an automatic
code formatter.

## Summary

### code formatting

  - Use consistent spacing around delimiters.
  - Use the same spacing as you would in regular prose.
  - Indent and align nested control structures, continuation lines, and
    embedded units consistently.
  - Distinguish between indentation for nested control structures and
    for continuation lines.
  - Use spaces for indentation, not the tab character (Nissen and Wallis
    1984, ยง2.2).
  - Align operators vertically to emphasize local program structure and
    semantics.
  - Use vertical alignment to enhance the readability of declarations.
  - Provide, at most, one declaration per line.
  - Indent all declarations in a single declarative part at the same
    level.
  - Align parameter modes and parentheses vertically.
  - Use blank lines to group logically related lines of text (NASA
    1987).
  - Highlight the top of each package or task specification, the top of
    each program unit body, and the end statement of each program unit.
  - Start each statement on a new line.
  - Write no more than one simple statement per line.
  - Break compound statements over multiple lines.
  - Adhere to a maximum line length limit for source code (Nissen and
    Wallis 1984, ยง2.3).
