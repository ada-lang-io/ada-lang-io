title: 9.5 Multiple Inheritance
---

Ada provides several mechanisms to support multiple inheritance, where
multiple inheritance is a means for incrementally building new
abstractions from existing ones, as defined at the beginning of this
chapter. Specifically, Ada supports multiple inheritance module
inclusion (via multiple with/use clauses), multiple inheritance
"is-implemented-using" via private extensions and record composition,
and multiple inheritance mixins via the use of generics, formal
packages, and access discriminants (Taft 1994).

### Multiple Inheritance Techniques

#### guideline

- Consider using type composition for implementation, as opposed to
  interface, inheritance.
- Consider using a generic to "mix in" functionality to a derivative
  of some core abstraction.
- Consider using access discriminants to support "full" multiple
  inheritance where an object must be referenceable as an entity of
  two or more distinct unrelated abstractions.

#### example

Both examples that follow are taken directly from Taft (1994). The first
shows how to use multiple inheritance techniques to create an abstract
type whose interface inherits from one type and whose implementation
inherits from another type. The second example shows how to enhance the
functionality of a basic abstraction by mixing in new features.

The abstract type Set_Of_Strings provides the interface to inherit:

```ada

type Set_Of_Strings is abstract tagged limited private;
type Element_Index is new Natural;  -- Index within set.
No_Element : constant Element_Index := 0;
Invalid_Index : exception;
procedure Enter(
  -- Enter an element into the set, return the index
  Set : in out Set_Of_Strings;
  S : String;
  Index : out Element_Index) is abstract;
procedure Remove(
  -- Remove an element from the set; ignore if not there
  Set : in out Set_Of_Strings;
  S : String) is abstract;
procedure Combine(
  -- Combine Additional_Set into Union_Set
  Union_Set : in out Set_Of_Strings;
  Additional_Set : Set_Of_Strings) is abstract;
procedure Intersect(
  -- Remove all elements of Removal_Set from Intersection_Set
  Intersection_Set : in out Set_Of_Strings;
  Removal_Set : Set_Of_Strings) is abstract;
function Size(Set : Set_Of_Strings) return Element_Index
  is abstract;
  -- Return a count of the number of elements in the set
function Index(
  -- Return the index of a given element;
  -- return No_Element if not there.
  Set : Set_Of_Strings;
  S : String) return Element_Index is abstract;
function Element(Index : Element_Index) return String is abstract;
  -- Return element at given index position
  -- raise Invalid_Index if no element there.
private
  type Set_Of_Strings is abstract tagged limited ...

The type Hashed_Set derives its interface from Set_of_Strings and its implementation from an existing (concrete) type Hash_Table:

type Hashed_Set(Table_Size : Positive) is
  new Set_Of_Strings with private;
-- Now we give the specs of the operations being implemented
procedure Enter(
  -- Enter an element into the set, return the index
  Set : in out Hashed_Set;
  S : String;
  Index : out Element_Index);
procedure Remove(
  -- Remove an element from the set; ignore if not there
  Set : in out Hashed_Set;
  S : String);
  -- . . . etc.
private
  type Hashed_Set(Table_Size : Positive) is
    new Set_Of_Strings with record
      Table : Hash_Table(1..Table_Size);
    end record;
```

In the package body, you define the bodies of the operations (i.e.,
Enter, Remove,Combine, Size, etc.) using the operations available on
Hash_Table. You must also provide any necessary "glue" code.

In this second example, the type Basic_Window responds to various
events and calls:

```ada

type Basic_Window is tagged limited private;
procedure Display(W : Basic_Window);
procedure Mouse_Click(W     : in out Basic_Window;
                      Where :        Mouse_Coords);
          . . .
```

You use mixins to add features such as labels, borders, menu bar, etc.:

```ada
generic
  type Some_Window is new Window with private;
  -- take in any descendant of Window
package Label_Mixin is
  type Window_With_Label is new Some_Window with private;
    -- Jazz it up somehow.
  -- Overridden operations:
  procedure Display(W : Window_With_Label);
  -- New operations:
  procedure Set_Label(W : in out Window_With_Label; S : String);
    -- Set the label
  function Label(W : Window_With_Label) return String;
    -- Fetch the label
private
  type Window_With_Label is
    new Some_Window with record
      Label : String_Quark := Null_Quark;
        -- An XWindows-Like unique ID for a string
    end record;
```

In the generic body, you implement any overridden operations as well as
the new operations. For example, you could implement the overridden
Display operation using some of the inherited operations:

```ada
procedure Display(W : Window_With_Label) is
begin
    Display(Some_Window(W));
      -- First display the window normally,
      -- by passing the buck to the parent type.
    if W.Label /= Null_Quark then
      -- Now display the label if it is not null
        Display_On_Screen(XCoord(W), YCoord(W)-5, Value(W.Label));
          -- Use two inherited functions on Basic_Window
          -- to get the coordinates where to display the label.
    end if;
end Display;
```

Assuming you have defined several generics with these additional
features, to create the desired window, you use a combination of generic
instantiations and private type extension, as shown in the following
code:

```ada

  type My_Window is new Basic_Window with private;
  . . .
private
  package Add_Label is new Label_Mixin(Basic_Window);
  package Add_Border is
    new Border_Mixin(Add_Label.Window_With_Label);
  package Add_Menu_Bar is
    new Menu_Bar_Mixin(Add_Border.Window_With_Border);
  type My_Window is
    new Add_Menu_Bar.Window_With_Menu_Bar with null record;
      -- Final window is a null extension of Window_With_Menu_Bar.
      -- We could instead make a record extension and
      -- add components for My_Window over and above those
      -- needed by the mixins.
```

The following example shows "full" multiple inheritance.

Assume previous definition of packages for Savings_Account and
Checking_Account. The following example shows the definition of an
interest-bearing checking account (NOW account):

```ada
with Savings_Account;
with Checking_Account;
package NOW_Account is

   type Object is tagged limited private;

   type Savings (Self : access Object'Class) is
      new Savings_Account.Object with null record;

   -- These need to be overridden to call through to "Self"
   procedure Deposit (Into_Account : in out Savings; ...);
   procedure Withdraw (...);
   procedure Earn_Interest (...);
   function Interest (...) return Float;
   function Balance (...) return Float;
   type Checking (Self : access Object'Class) is
      new Checking_Account.Object with null record;

   procedure Deposit (Into_Account : in out Checking; ...);
   ...
   function Balance (...) return Float;

   -- These operations will call-through to Savings_Account or
   -- Checking_Account operations. "Inherits" in this way all savings and
   -- checking operations

   procedure Deposit (Into_Account : in out Object; ...);
   ...
   procedure Earn_Interest (...);
   ...
   function Balance (...) return Float;

private

   -- Could alternatively have Object be derived from either
   -- Savings_Account.Object or Checking_Account.Object
   type Object is tagged
      record
         As_Savings  : Savings (Object'Access);
         As_Checking : Checking (Object'Access);
      end record;

end NOW_Account;
```

Another possibility is that the savings and checking accounts are both
implemented based on a common Account abstraction, resulting in
inheriting a Balance state twice for NOW_Account.Object. To resolve
this ambiguity, you need to use an abstract type hierarchy for the
multiple inheritance of interface and separate mixins for the multiple
inheritance of implementation.

#### rationale

In other languages such as Eiffel and C++, multiple inheritance serves
many purposes. In Eiffel, for instance, you must use inheritance both
for module inclusion and for inheritance itself (Taft 1994). Ada
provides context clauses for module inclusion and child libraries for
finer modularization control. Ada does not provide a separate syntax for
multiple inheritance. Rather, it provides a set of building blocks in
type extension and composition that allow you to mix in additional
behaviors.

A library of mixins allows the client to mix and match in order to
develop an implementation. Also see Guideline 8.3.8 about implementing
mixins.

You should not use multiple inheritance to derive an abstraction that is
essentially unrelated to its parent(s). Thus, you should not try to
derive a menu abstraction by inheriting from a command line type and a
window type. However, if you have a basic abstraction such as a window,
you can use multiple inheritance mixins to create a more sophisticated
abstraction, where a mixin is the package containing the type(s) and
operations that will extend the parent abstraction.

Use self-referential data structures to implement types with "full"
multiple inheritance ("multiple polymorphism").

A common mistake is to use multiple inheritance for parts-of relations.
When a type is composed of several others types, you should use
heterogeneous data structuring techniques, discussed in Guideline 5.4.2.
