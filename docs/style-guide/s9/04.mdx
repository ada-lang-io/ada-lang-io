title: 9.4 Managing Visibility

### Derived Tagged Types

#### guideline

- Consider giving derived tagged types the same visibility to the
  parent type as other clients of the parent.
- Define a derived tagged type in a child of the package that defines
  the base type if the implementation of the derived type requires
  greater visibility into the implementation of the base type than
  other clients of the base type require.

#### example

The following example illustrates the need for a derived type to have
greater visibility into the implementation of the base type than other
clients of the base type. In this example of a stack class hierarchy,
Push and Pop routines provide a homogeneous interface for all variations
of stacks. However, the implementation of these operations requires
greater visibility into the base types due to the differences in the
data elements. This example is adapted from Barbey, Kempe, and
Strohmeier (1994):

```ada
generic
   type Item_Type is private;
package Generic_Stack is
   type Abstract_Stack_Type is abstract tagged limited private;
   procedure Push (Stack : in out Abstract_Stack_Type;
                   Item  : in     Item_Type) is abstract;
   procedure Pop (Stack : in out Abstract_Stack_Type;
                  Item  :    out Item_Type) is abstract;
   function Size (Stack : Abstract_Stack_Type) return Natural;
   Full_Error  : exception; -- May be raised by Push
   Empty_Error : exception; -- May be raised by Pop
private
   type Abstract_Stack_Type is abstract tagged limited
      record
         Size : Natural := 0;
      end record;
end Generic_Stack;
package body Generic_Stack is
   function Size (Stack : Abstract_Stack_Type)
      return Natural is
   begin
      return Stack.Size;
   end Size;
end Generic_Stack;
--
-- Now, a bounded stack can be derived in a child package as follows:
--
----------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
package Generic_Stack.Generic_Bounded_Stack is
   type Stack_Type (Max : Positive) is
      new Abstract_Stack_Type with private;
   -- override all abstract subprograms
   procedure Push (Stack : in out Stack_Type;
                   Item  : in     Item_Type);
   procedure Pop (Stack : in out Stack_Type;
                  Item  :    out Item_Type);
private
   type Table_Type is array (Positive range <>) of Item_Type;
   type Stack_Type (Max : Positive) is new Abstract_Stack_Type with
      record
         Table : Table_Type (1 .. Max);
      end record;
end Generic_Stack.Generic_Bounded_Stack;
----------------------------------------------------------------------
package body Generic_Stack.Generic_Bounded_Stack is

   procedure Push (Stack : in out Stack_Type;
                   Item  : in     Item_Type) is
   begin

      -- The new bounded stack needs visibility into the base type
      --   in order to update the Size element of the stack type
      --   when adding or removing items.

      if (Stack.Size = Stack.Max) then
         raise Full_Error;
      else
         Stack.Size := Stack.Size + 1;
         Stack.Table(Stack.Size) := Item;
      end if;
   end Push;

   procedure Pop (Stack : in out Stack_Type;
                  Item  :    out Item_Type) is
   begin
      ...
   end Pop;

end Generic_Stack.Generic_Bounded_Stack;
```

#### rationale

If the derived type can be defined without any special visibility of the
base type, this provides for the best possible decoupling of the
implementation of the derived type from changes in the implementation of
the base type. On the other hand, the operations of an extension of a
tagged type may need additional information from the base type that is
not commonly needed by other clients.

When the implementation of a derived tagged type requires visibility of
the implementation of the base type, use a child package to define the
derived type. Rather than providing additional public operations for
this information, it is better to place the definition of the derived
type in a child package. This gives the derived type the necessary
visibility without risking misuse by other clients.

This situation is likely to arise when you build a data structure with a
homogeneous interface but whose data elements have a heterogeneous
implementation. See also Guidelines 8.4.8, 9.2.1, and 9.3.5.
