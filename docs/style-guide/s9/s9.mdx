title: 9. Object-Oriented Features

This chapter recommends ways of using Ada's object-oriented features.
Ada supports inheritance and polymorphism, providing the programmer some
effective techniques and building blocks. Disciplined use of these
features will promote programs that are easier to read and modify. These
features also give the programmer flexibility in building reusable
components.

The following definitions are provided in order to make this chapter
more understandable. The essential characteristics of object-oriented
programming are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These are
defined as follows in the Rationale (1995, §§4.1 and III.1.2):

- Inheritance  
  A means for incrementally building new abstractions from an existing
  one by "inheriting" their properties without disturbing the
  implementation of the original abstraction or the existing clients.
- Multiple Inheritance  
  The means of inheriting components and operations from two or more
  parent abstractions.
- Mixin Inheritance  
  Multiple inheritance in which one or more of the parent abstractions
  cannot have instances of their own and exist only to provide a set
  of properties for abstractions inheriting from them.
- Polymorphism  
  A means of factoring out the differences among a collection of
  abstractions, such that programs may be written in terms of the
  common properties.

- Static polymorphism is provided through the generic parameter
  mechanism whereby a generic unit may be instantiated at compile time
  with any type from a class of types.
- Dynamic polymorphism is provided through the use of so-called
  class-wide types and the distinction is then made at runtime on the
  basis of the value of the tag ("effectively a hidden discriminant
  identifying the type" \[Rationale 1995, §II.1\]).

As stated in the Ada Reference Manual (1995, Annex N):

> A type has an associated set of values and a set of primitive
> operations that implement the fundamental aspects of its semantics.

A class is a set of types that is closed under derivation, which means
that if a given type is in the class, then all types derived from that
type are also in the class. The set of types of a class share common
properties, such as their primitive operations. The semantics of a class
include expected behavior and exceptions.

An object is either a constant or variable defined from a type (class).
An object contains a value. A subcomponent of an object is itself an
object.

Guidelines in this chapter are frequently worded "consider ..." because
hard and fast rules cannot apply in all situations. The specific choice
you make in a given situation involves design tradeoffs. The rationale
for these guidelines is intended to give you insight into some of these
tradeoffs.
