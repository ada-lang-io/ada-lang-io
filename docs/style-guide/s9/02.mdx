title: 9.2 Tagged Type Hierarchies
---

You should use inheritance primarily as a mechanism for implementing a
class hierarchy from an object-oriented design. A class hierarchy should
be a generalization/specialization ("is-a") relationship. This
relationship may also be referred to as "is-a-kind-of," not to be
confused with "is an instance of." This "is-a" usage of inheritance is
in contrast to other languages in which inheritance is used also to
provide the equivalent of the Ada context clauses with and use. In Ada,
you first identify the external modules of interest via with clauses and
then choose selectively whether to make only the name of the module
(package) visible or its contents (via a use clause).

### Tagged Types

#### guideline

- Consider using type extension when designing an is-a
  (generalization/specialization) hierarchy.
- Use tagged types to preserve a common interface across differing
  implementations (Taft 1995a).
- When defining a tagged type in a package, consider including a
  definition of a general access type to the corresponding class-wide
  type.
- In general, define only one tagged type per package.

#### example

Consider the type structure for a set of two-dimensional geometric
objects positioned in a Cartesian coordinate system (Barnes 1996). The
ancestor or root type Object is a tagged record. The components common
to this type and all its descendants are an x and y coordinate. Various
descendant types include points, circles, and arbitrary shapes. Except
for points, these descendant types extend the root type with additional
components; for example, the circle adds a radius component:

```ada
type Object is tagged
   record
      X_Coord : Float;
      Y_Coord : Float;
   end record;

type Circle is new Object with
   record
      Radius : Float;
   end record;

type Point is new Object with null record;

type Shape is new Object with
   record
      -- other components
      ...
   end record;
```

The following is an example of general access type to the corresponding
class-wide type:

```ada
package Employee is
   type Object is tagged limited private;
   type Reference is access all Object'class;
   ...
private
   ...
end Employee;
```

#### rationale

You can derive new types from both tagged and untagged types, but the
effects of this derivation are different. When you derive from an
untagged type, you are creating a new type whose implementation is
identical to the parent. Values of the derived types are subject to
strong type checking; thus, you cannot mix the proverbial apples and
oranges. When you derive a new type from an untagged type, you are not
allowed to extend it with new components. You are effectively creating a
new interface without changing the underlying implementation (Taft
1995a).

In deriving from a tagged type, you can extend the type with new
components. Each descendant can extend a common interface (the
parent's). The union of a tagged type and its descendants form a class,
and a class offers some unique features not available to untagged
derivations. You can write class-wide operations that can be applied to
any object that is a member of the class. You can also provide new
implementations for the descendants of tagged types, either by
overriding inherited primitive operations or by creating new primitive
operations. Finally, tagged types can be used as the basis for multiple
inheritance building blocks (see Guideline 9.5.1).

Reference semantics are very commonly used in object-oriented
programming. In particular, heterogeneous polymorphic data structures
based on tagged types require the use of access types. It is convenient
to have a common definition for such a type provided to any client of
the package defining the tagged type. A heterogeneous polymorphic data
structure is a composite data structure (such as an array) whose
elements have a homogeneous interface (i.e., an access to class-wide
type) and whose elements' implementations are heterogeneous (i.e., the
implementation of the elements uses different specific types). See also
Guidelines 9.3.5 on polymorphism and 9.4.1 on managing visibility of
tagged type hierarchies.

In Ada, the primitive operations of a type are implicitly associated
with the type through scoping rules. The definition of a tagged type and
a set of operations corresponds together to the "traditional"
object-oriented programming concept of a "class." Putting these into a
package provides a clean encapsulation mechanism.

#### exceptions

If the root of the hierarchy does not define a complete set of values
and operations, then use an abstract tagged type (see Guideline 9.2.4).
This abstract type can be thought of as the least common denominator of
the class, essentially a conceptual and incomplete type.

If a descendant needs to remove one of the components or primitive
operations of its ancestor, it may not be appropriate to extend the
tagged type.

An exception to using reference semantics is when a type is exported
that would not be used in a data structure or made part of a collection.

If the implementation of two tagged types requires mutual visibility and
the two types are generally used together, then it may be best to define
them together in one package, though thought should be given to using
child packages instead (see Guideline 9.4.1). Also, it can be convenient
to define a small hierarchy of (completely) abstract types (or a small
part of a larger hierarchy) all in one package specification; however,
the negative impact on maintainability may outweigh the convenience. You
do not provide a package body in this situation unless you have declared
nonabstract operations on members of the hierarchy.

### Properties of Dispatching Operations

#### guideline

- The implementation of the dispatching operations of each type in a
  derivation class rooted in a tagged type T should conform to the
  expected semantics of the corresponding dispatching operations of
  the class-wide type T'Class.

#### example

The key point of both of the alternatives in the following example is
that it must be possible to use the class-wide type
Transaction.Object'Class polymorphically without having to study the
implementations of each of the types derived from the root type
Transaction.Object. In addition, new transactions can be added to the
derivation class without invalidating the existing transaction
processing code. These are the important practical consequences of the
design rule captured in the guideline:

```ada
with Database;
package Transaction is

   type Object (Data : access Database.Object'Class) is abstract tagged limited
      record
         Has_Executed : Boolean := False;
      end record;

   function Is_Valid (T : Object) return Boolean;
   -- checks that Has_Executed is False

   procedure Execute (T : in out Object);
   -- sets Has_Executed to True

   Is_Not_Valid : exception;

end Transaction;
```

The precondition of Execute(T) for all T in Transaction.Object'Class is
that Is_Valid(T) is True. The postcondition is the T.Has_Executed =
True. This model is trivially satisfied by the root type
Transaction.Object.

Consider the following derived type:

```ada
with Transaction;
with Personnel;
package Pay_Transaction is
   type Object is new Transaction.Object with
      record
         Employee     : Personnel.Name;
         Hours_Worked : Personnel.Time;
      end record;
   function Is_Valid (T : Object) return Boolean;
   -- checks that Employee is a valid name, Hours_Worked is a valid
   -- amount of work time and Has_Executed = False
   procedure Has_Executed (T : in out Object);
   -- computes the pay earned by the Employee for the given Hours_Worked
   -- and updates this in the database T.Data, then sets Has_Executed to True
end Pay_Transaction;
```

The precondition for the specific operation Pay_Transaction.Execute(T)
is that Pay_Transaction.Is_Valid(T) is True, which is the same
precondition as for the dispatching operation Execute on the class-wide
type. (The actual validity check is different, but the statement of the
"precondition" is the same.) The postcondition for
Pay_Transaction.Execute(T) includes T.Has_Executed = True but also
includes the appropriate condition on T.Data for computation of pay.

The class-wide transaction type can then be properly used as follows:

```ada
type Transaction_Reference is access all Transaction.Object'Class;
type Transaction_List is array (Positive range <>) of Transaction_Reference;
procedure Process (Action : in Transaction_List) is
begin
   for I in Action'Range loop
   -- Note that calls to Is_Valid and Execute are dispatching
      if Transaction.Is_Valid(Action(I).all) then
         -- the precondition for Execute is satisfied
         Transaction.Execute(Action(I).all);
         -- the postcondition Action(I).Has_Executed = True is
         -- guaranteed to be satisfied (as well as any stronger conditions
         -- depending on the specific value of Action(I))
      else
         -- deal with the error
         ...
      end if;
   end loop;
end Process;
```

If you had not defined the operation Is_Valid on transactions, then the
validity condition for pay computation (valid name and hours worked)
would have to directly become the precondition for
Pay_Transaction.Execute. But this would be a "stronger" precondition
than that on the class-wide dispatching operation, violating the
guideline. As a result of this violation, there would be no way to
guarantee the precondition of a dispatching call to Execute, leading to
unexpected failures.

An alternative resolution to this problem is to define an exception to
be raised by an Execute operation when the transaction is not valid.
This behavior becomes part of the semantic model for the class-wide
type: the precondition for Execute(T) becomes simply True (i.e., always
valid), but the postcondition becomes "either" the exception is not
raised and Has_Executed = True "or" the exception is raised and
Has_Executed = False. The implementations of Execute in all derived
transaction types would then need to satisfy the new postcondition. It
is important that the "same" exception be raised by "all"
implementations because this is part of the expected semantic model of
the class-wide type.

With the alternative approach, the above processing loop becomes:

```ada
procedure Process (Action : in Transaction_List) is
begin

   for I in Action'Range loop

    Process_A_Transaction:
      begin

         -- there is no precondition for Execute
         Transaction.Execute (Action(I).all);
         -- since no exception was raised, the postcondition
         -- Action(I).Has_Executed = True is guaranteed (as well as
         -- any stronger condition depending on the specific value of
         -- Action(I))

      exception
         when Transaction.Is_Not_Valid =>
            -- the exception was raised, so Action(I).Has_Executed = False

            -- deal with the error
            ...

      end Process_A_Transaction;

   end loop;

end Process;
```

#### rationale

All the properties expected of a class-wide type by clients of that type
should be meaningful for any specific types in the derivation class of
the class-wide type. This rule is related to the object-oriented
programming "substitutability principle" for consistency between the
semantics of an object-oriented superclass and its subclasses (Wegner
and Zdonik 1988). However, the separation of the polymorphic class-wide
type T'Class from the root specific type T in Ada 95 clarifies this
principle as a design rule on derivation classes rather than a
correctness principle for derivation itself.

When a dispatching operation is used on a variable of a class-wide type
T'Class, the actual implementation executed will depend dynamically on
the actual tag of the value in the variable. In order to rationally use
T'Class, it must be possible to understand the semantics of the
operations on T'Class without having to study the implementation of the
operations for each of the types in the derivation class rooted in T.
Further, a new type added to this derivation class should not invalidate
this overall understanding of T'Class because this could invalidate
existing uses of the class-wide type. Thus, there needs to be an overall
set of semantic properties of the operations of T'Class that is
preserved by the implementations of the corresponding dispatching
operations of all the types in the derivation class.

One way to capture the semantic properties of an operation is to define
a "precondition" that must be true before the operation is invoked and a
"postcondition" that must be true (given the precondition) after the
operation has executed. You can (formally or informally) define pre- and
postconditions for each operation of T'Class without reference to the
implementations of dispatching operations of specific types. These
semantic properties define the "minimum" set of properties common to all
types in the derivation class. To preserve this minimum set of
properties, the implementation of the dispatching operations of all the
types in the derivation class rooted in T (including the root type T)
should have (the same or) weaker preconditions than the corresponding
operations of T'Class and (the same or) stronger postconditions than the
T'Class operations. This means that any invocation of a dispatching
operation on T'Class will result in the execution of an implementation
that requires no more than what is expected of the dispatching operation
in general (though it could require less) and delivers a result that is
no less than what is expected (though it could do more).

#### exceptions

Tagged types and type extension may sometimes be used primarily for type
implementation reasons rather than for polymorphism and dispatching. In
particular, a nontagged private type may be implemented using a type
extension of a tagged type. In such cases, it may not be necessary for
the implementation of the derived type to preserve the semantic
properties of the class-wide type because the membership of the new type
in the tagged type derivation class will not generally be known to
clients of the type.

### Controlled Types

#### guideline

- Consider using a controlled type whenever a type allocates resources
  that must be deallocated or otherwise "cleaned up" on destruction or
  overwriting.
- Use a derivation from a controlled type in preference to providing
  an explicit "cleanup" operation that must be called by clients of
  the type.
- When overriding the adjustment and finalization procedures derived
  from controlled types, define the finalization procedure to undo the
  effects of the adjustment procedure.
- Derived type initialization procedures should call the
  initialization procedure of their parent as part of their
  type-specific initialization.
- Derived type finalization procedures should call the finalization
  procedure of their parent as part of their type-specific
  finalization.
- Consider deriving a data structure's components rather than the
  enclosing data structure from a controlled type.

#### example

The following example demonstrates the use of controlled types in the
implementation of a simple linked list. Because the Linked_List type is
derived from Ada.Finalization.Controlled, the Finalize procedure will be
called automatically when objects of the Linked_List type complete
their scope of execution:

```ada
with Ada.Finalization;
package Linked_List_Package is
   type Iterator is private;
   type Data_Type is ...
   type Linked_List is new Ada.Finalization.Controlled with private;
   function Head (List : Linked_List) return Iterator;
   procedure Get_Next (Element  : in out Iterator;
                       Data     :    out Data_Type);
   procedure Add (List     : in out Linked_List;
                  New_Data : in     Data_Type);
   procedure Finalize (List : in out Linked_List); -- reset Linked_List structure
   -- Initialize and Adjust are left to the default implementation.
private
   type Node;
   type Node_Ptr is access Node;
   type Node is
      record
         Data : Data_Type;
         Next : Node_Ptr;
      end record;
   type Iterator is new Node_Ptr;
   type Linked_List is new Ada.Finalization.Controlled with
      record
         Number_Of_Items : Natural := 0;
         Root            : Node_Ptr;
      end record;
end Linked_List_Package;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
package body Linked_List_Package is

   function Head (List : Linked_List) return Iterator is
      Head_Node_Ptr : Iterator;
   begin
      Head_Node_Ptr := Iterator (List.Root);
      return Head_Node_Ptr;  -- Return the head element of the list
   end Head;

   procedure Get_Next (Element : in out Iterator;
                       Data    :    out Data_Type) is
   begin
      --
      -- Given an element, return the next element (or null)
      --
   end Get_Next;

   procedure Add (List     : in out Linked_List;
                  New_Data : in     Data_Type) is
   begin
      --
      -- Add a new element to the head of the list
      --
   end Add;

   procedure Finalize (List : in out Linked_List) is
   begin
      -- Release all storage used by the linked list
      --   and reinitialize.
   end Finalize;

end Linked_List_Package;
```

#### rationale

The three controlling operations, Initialize, Adjust, and Finalize,
serve as automatically called procedures that control three primitive
activities in the life of an object (Ada Reference Manual 1995, §7.6).
When an assignment to an object of a type derived from Controlled
occurs, adjustment and finalization work in tandem. Finalization cleans
up the object being overwritten (e.g., reclaims heap space), then
adjustment finishes the assignment work once the value being assigned
has been copied (e.g., to implement a deep copy).

You can ensure that the derived type's initialization is consistent with
that of the parent by calling the parent type's initialization from the
derived type's initialization.

You can ensure that the derived type's finalization is consistent with
that of the parent by calling the parent type's finalization from the
derived type's finalization.

In general, you should call parent initialization before
descendant-specific initialization. Similarly, you should call parent
finalization after descendant-specific finalization. (You may position
the parent initialization and/or finalization at the beginning or end of
the procedure.)

### Abstract Types

#### guideline

- Consider using abstract types and operations in creating
  classification schemes, for example, a taxonomy, in which only the
  leaf objects will be meaningful in the application.
- Consider declaring root types and internal nodes in a type tree as
  abstract.
- Consider using abstract types for generic formal derived types.
- Consider using abstract types to develop different implementations
  of a single abstraction.

#### example

In a banking application, there are a wide variety of account types,
each with different features and restrictions. Some of the variations
are fees, overdraft protection, minimum balances, allowable account
linkages (e.g., checking and savings), and rules on opening the account.
Common to all bank accounts are ownership attributes: unique account
number, owner name(s), and owner tax identification number(s). Common
operations across all types of accounts are opening, depositing,
withdrawing, providing current balance, and closing. The common
attributes and operations describe the conceptual bank account. This
idealized bank account can form the root of a
generalization/specialization hierarchy that describes the bank's array
of products. By using abstract tagged types, you ensure that only
account objects corresponding to a specific product will be created.
Because any abstract operations must be overridden with each derivation,
you ensure that any restrictions for a specialized account are
implemented (e.g., how and when the account-specific fee structure is
applied):

```ada
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
package Bank_Account_Package is

   type Bank_Account_Type is abstract tagged limited private;
   type Money is delta 0.01 digits 15;

   -- The following abstract operations must be overridden for
   --   each derivation, thus ensuring that any restrictions
   --   for specialized accounts will be implemented.

   procedure Open (Account : in out Bank_Account_Type) is abstract;

   procedure Close (Account : in out Bank_Account_Type) is abstract;

   procedure Deposit (Account : in out Bank_Account_Type;
                      Amount  : in     Money) is abstract;

   procedure Withdraw (Account : in out Bank_Account_Type;
                       Amount  : in     Money) is abstract;

   function Balance (Account : Bank_Account_Type)
     return Money is abstract;

private
   type Account_Number_Type is ...
   type Account_Owner_Type  is ...
   type Tax_ID_Number_Type  is ...

   type Bank_Account_Type is abstract tagged limited
      record
         Account_Number : Account_Number_Type;
         Account_Owner  : Account_Owner_Type;
         Tax_ID_Number  : Tax_ID_Number_Type;
      end record;
end Bank_Account_Package;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Now, other specialized accounts such as a savings account can
-- be derived from Bank_Account_Type as in the following example.
-- Note that abstract types are still used to ensure that only
-- account objects corresponding to specific products will be
-- created.with Bank_Account_Package;
with Bank_Account_Package;
package Savings_Account_Package is
   type Savings_Account_Type is abstract
      new Bank_Account_Package.Bank_Account_Type with private;
   -- We must override the abstract operations provided
   --   by Bank_Account_Package.  Since we are still declaring
   --   these operations to be abstract, they must also be
   --   overridden by the specializations of Savings_Account_Type.
   procedure Open (Account : in out Savings_Account_Type) is abstract;
   procedure Close (Account : in out Savings_Account_Type) is abstract;

   procedure Deposit (Account : in out Savings_Account_Type;
                      Amount  : in     Bank_Account_Package.Money) is abstract;

   procedure Withdraw (Account : in out Savings_Account_Type;
                       Amount  : in     Bank_Account_Package.Money) is abstract;

   function Balance (Account : Savings_Account_Type)
     return Bank_Account_Package.Money is abstract;

private
   type Savings_Account_Type is abstract
      new Bank_Account_Package.Bank_Account_Type with
         record
            Minimum_Balance : Bank_Account_Package.Money;
         end record;
end Savings_Account_Package;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

See the abstract set package in Guideline 9.5.1 for an example of
creating an abstraction with a single interface and the potential for
multiple implementations. The example only shows one possible
implementation; however, you could provide an alternate implementation
of the Hashed_Set abstraction using other data structures.

#### rationale

In many classification schemes, for example, a taxonomy, only objects at
the leaves of the classification tree are meaningful in the application.
In other words, the root of the hierarchy does not define a complete set
of values and operations for use by the application. The use of
"abstract" guarantees that there will be no objects of the root or
intermediate nodes. Concrete derivations of the abstract types and
subprograms are required so that the leaves of the tree become objects
that a client can manipulate.

You can only declare abstract subprograms when the root type is also
abstract. This is useful as you build an abstraction that forms the
basis for a family of abstractions. By declaring the primitive
subprograms to be abstract, you can write the "common class-wide parts
of a system . . . without being dependent on the properties of any
specific type at all" (Rationale 1995, §4.2).

Abstract types and operations can help you resolve problems when your
tagged type hierarchy violates the expected semantics of the class-wide
type dispatching operations. The Rationale (1995, §4.2) explains:

> When building an abstraction that is to form the basis of a class
> of types, it is often convenient not to provide actual subprograms for
> the root type but just abstract subprograms which can be replaced when
> inherited. This is only allowed if the root type is declared as
> abstract; objects of an abstract type cannot exist. This technique
> enables common class-wide parts of a system to be written without being
> dependent on the properties of any specific type at all. Dispatching
> always works because it is known that there can never be any objects of
> the abstract type and so the abstract subprograms could never be called.

See Guidelines 8.3.8 and 9.2.1.

The multiple inheritance techniques discussed in Guideline 9.5.1 make
use of abstract tagged types. The basic abstraction is defined using an
abstract tagged (limited) private type (whose full type declaration is a
null record) with a small set of abstract primitive operations. While
abstract operations have no bodies and thus cannot be called, they are
inherited. Derivatives of the abstraction then extend the root type with
components that provide the data representation and override the
abstract operations to provide callable implementations (Rationale 1995,
§4.4.3). This technique allows you to build multiple implementations of
a single abstraction. You declare a single interface and vary the
specifics of the data representation and operation implementation.

#### notes

When you use abstract data types as described in this guideline, you can
have multiple implementations of the same abstraction available to you
within a single program. This technique differs from the idea of writing
multiple package bodies to provide different implementations of the
abstraction defined in a package specification because with the package
body technique, you can only include one of the implementations (i.e.,
bodies) in your program.
