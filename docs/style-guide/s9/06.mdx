### tagged type hierarchies

- Consider using type extension when designing an is-a
  (generalization/specialization) hierarchy.
- Use tagged types to preserve a common interface across differing
  implementations (Taft 1995a).
- When defining a tagged type in a package, consider including a
  definition of a general access type to the corresponding class-wide
  type.
- In general, define only one tagged type per package.
- The implementation of the dispatching operations of each type in a
  derivation class rooted in a tagged type T should conform to the
  expected semantics of the corresponding dispatching operations of the
  class-wide type T'Class.
- Consider using a controlled type whenever a type allocates resources
  that must be deallocated or otherwise "cleaned up" on destruction or
  overwriting.
- Use a derivation from a controlled type in preference to providing an
  explicit "cleanup" operation that must be called by clients of the
  type.
- When overriding the adjustment and finalization procedures derived
  from controlled types, define the finalization procedure to undo the
  effects of the adjustment procedure.
- Derived type initialization procedures should call the initialization
  procedure of their parent as part of their type-specific
  initialization.
- Derived type finalization procedures should call the finalization
  procedure of their parent as part of their type-specific finalization.
- Consider deriving a data structure's components rather than the
  enclosing data structure from a controlled type.
- Consider using abstract types and operations in creating
  classification schemes, for example, a taxonomy, in which only the
  leaf objects will be meaningful in the application.
- Consider declaring root types and internal nodes in a type tree as
  abstract.
- Consider using abstract types for generic formal derived types.
- Consider using abstract types to develop different implementations of
  a single abstraction.

### tagged type operations

- Consider declaring a primitive abstract operation based on the absence
  of a meaningful "default" behavior.
- Consider declaring a primitive nonabstract operation based on the
  presence of a meaningful "default" behavior.
- When overriding an operation, the overriding subprogram should not
  raise exceptions that are not known to the users of the overridden
  subprogram.
- If redispatching is used in the implementation of the operations of a
  type, with the specific intent that some of the redispatched-to
  operations be overridden by specializations for the derived types,
  then document this intent clearly in the specification as part of the
  "interface" of a parent type with its derived types.
- When redispatching is used (for any reason) in the implementation of a
  primitive operation of a tagged type, then document (in some
  project-consistent way) this use in the body of the operation
  subprogram so that it can be easily found during maintenance.
- Consider using a class-wide operation (i.e., an operation with
  parameter\[s\] of a class-wide type) when an operation can be written,
  compiled, and tested without knowing all the possible descendants of a
  given tagged type (Barnes 1996).
- Consider using a class-wide operation when you do not want an
  operation to be inherited and/or overridden.
- Avoid declaring a constructor as a primitive abstract operation.
- Use a primitive abstract operation to declare an initialization
  function or constructor only when objects of the inheriting derived
  types will not require additional parameters for initialization.
- Consider using access discriminants to provide parameters to default
  initialization.
- Use constructors for explicit initialization.
- Consider splitting the initialization and construction of an object.
- Consider declaring a constructor operation in a child package.
- Consider declaring a constructor operation to return an access value
  to the constructed object (Dewar 1995).
- When you redefine the "=" operator on a tagged type, make sure that it
  has the expected behavior in extensions of this type and override it
  if necessary.
- Consider using class-wide programming to provide run-time, dynamic
  polymorphism when constructing larger, reusable, extensible
  frameworks.
- When possible, use class-wide programming rather than variant records.
- Use class-wide programming to provide a consistent interface across
  the set of types in the tagged type hierarchy (i.e., class).
- Consider using generics to define a new type in terms of an existing
  type, either as an extension or as a container, collection, or
  composite data structure.
- Avoid using type extensions for parameterized abstractions when
  generics provide a more appropriate mechanism.

### managing visibility

- Consider giving derived tagged types the same visibility to the parent
  type as other clients of the parent.
- Define a derived tagged type in a child of the package that defines
  the base type if the implementation of the derived type requires
  greater visibility into the implementation of the base type than other
  clients of the base type require.

### multiple inheritance

- Consider using type composition for implementation, as opposed to
  interface, inheritance.
- Consider using a generic to "mix in" functionality to a derivative of
  some core abstraction.
- Consider using access discriminants to support "full" multiple
  inheritance where an object must be referenceable as an entity of two
  or more distinct unrelated abstractions.
