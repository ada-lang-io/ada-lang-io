title: 8.4 Independence
---

A reusable part should be as independent as possible from other reusable
parts. A potential user is less inclined to reuse a part if that part
requires the use of other parts that seem unnecessary. The "extra
baggage" of the other parts wastes time and space. A user would like to
be able to reuse only that part that is perceived as useful. The concept
of a "part" is intentionally vague here. A single package does not need
to be independent of each other package in a reuse library if the
"parts" from that library that are typically reused are entire
subsystems. If the entire subsystem is perceived as providing a useful
function, the entire subsystem is reused. However, the subsystem should
not be tightly coupled to all the other subsystems in the reuse library
so that it is difficult or impossible to reuse the subsystem without
reusing the entire library. Coupling between reusable parts should only
occur when it provides a strong benefit perceptible to the user.

### Subsystem Design

#### guideline

- Consider structuring subsystems so that operations that are only
  used in a particular context are in different child packages than
  operations used in a different context.
- Consider declaring context-independent functionality in the parent
  package and context-dependent functionality in child packages.

#### rationale

The generic unit is a basic building block. Generic parameterization can
be used to break dependencies between program units so that they can be
reused separately. However, it is often the case that a set of units,
particularly a set of packages, are to be reused together as a
subsystem. In this case, the packages can be collected into a hierarchy
of child packages, with private packages to hide internal details. The
hierarchy may or may not be generic. Using the child packages allows
subsystems to be reused without incorporating too many extraneous
operations because the unused child packages can be discarded in the new
environment.

See also Guidelines 4.1.6 and 8.3.1.

### Using Generic Parameters to Reduce Coupling

#### guideline

- Minimize with clauses on reusable parts, especially on their
  specifications.
- Consider using generic parameters instead of with statements to
  reduce the number of context clauses on a reusable part.
- Consider using generic formal package parameters to import directly
  all the types and operations defined in an instance of a preexisting
  generic.

#### example

A procedure like the following:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Package_A;
procedure Produce_And_Store_A is
   ...
begin  -- Produce_And_Store_A
   ...
   Package_A.Produce (...);
   ...
   Package_A.Store (...);
   ...
end Produce_And_Store_A;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

can be rewritten as a generic unit:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   with procedure Produce (...);
   with procedure Store   (...);
procedure Produce_And_Store;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
procedure Produce_And_Store is
   ...
begin  -- Produce_And_Store
   ...
   Produce (...);
   ...
   Store   (...);
   ...
end Produce_And_Store;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

and then instantiated:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Package_A;
with Produce_And_Store;
procedure Produce_And_Store_A is
   new Produce_And_Store (Produce => Package_A.Produce,
                          Store   => Package_A.Store);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

Context (with) clauses specify the names of other units upon which this
unit depends. Such dependencies cannot and should not be entirely
avoided, but it is a good idea to minimize the number of them that occur
in the specification of a unit. Try to move them to the body, leaving
the specification independent of other units so that it is easier to
understand in isolation. Also, organize your reusable parts in such a
way that the bodies of the units do not contain large numbers of
dependencies on each other. Partitioning your library into independent
functional areas with no dependencies spanning the boundaries of the
areas is a good way to start. Finally, reduce dependencies by using
generic formal parameters instead of with statements, as shown in the
example above. If the units in a library are too tightly coupled, then
no single part can be reused without reusing most or all of the library.

The first (nongeneric) version of Produce_And_Store_A above is
difficult to reuse because it depends on Package_A that may not be
general purpose or generally available. If the operation
Produce_And_Store has reuse potential that is reduced by this
dependency, a generic unit and an instantiation should be produced as
shown above. The with clause for Package_A has been moved from the
Produce_And_Store generic procedure, which encapsulates the reusable
algorithm to the Produce_And_Store_A instantiation. Instead of naming
the package that provides the required operations, the generic unit
simply lists the required operations themselves. This increases the
independence and reusability of the generic unit.

This use of generic formal parameters in place of with clauses also
allows visibility at a finer granularity. The with clause on the
nongeneric version of Produce_And_Store_A makes all of the contents
of Package_A visible to Produce_And_Store_A, while the generic
parameters on the generic version make only the Produce and Store
operations available to the generic instantiation.

Generic formal packages allow for "safer and simpler composition of
generic abstractions" ( Rationale 1995, ยง12.6). The generic formal
package allows you to group a set of related types and their operations
into a single unit, avoiding having to list each type and operation as
an individual generic formal parameter. This technique allows you to
show clearly that you are extending the functionality of one generic
with another generic, effectively parameterizing one abstraction with
another.

### Coupling Due to Pragmas

#### guideline

- In the specification of a generic library unit, use pragma
  Elaborate_Body.

#### example

```ada
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   ...
package Stack is

   pragma Elaborate_Body (Stack); -- in case the body is not yet elaborated

   ...
end Stack;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Stack;
package My_Stack is
   new Stack (...);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
package body Stack is
begin
   ...
end Stack;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

The elaboration order of compilation units is only constrained to follow
the compilation order. Furthermore, any time you have an instantiation
as a library unit or an instantiation in a library package, Ada requires
that you elaborate the body of the generic being instantiated before
elaborating the instantiation itself. Because a generic library unit
body may be compiled after an instantiation of that generic, the body
may not necessarily be elaborated at the time of the instantiation,
causing a Program_Error. Using pragma Elaborate_Body avoids this by
requiring that the generic unit body be elaborated immediately after the
specification, whatever the compilation order.

When there is clear requirement for a recursive dependency, you should
use pragma Elaborate_Body. This situation arises, for example, when you
have a recursive dependency (i.e., package A's body depends on package
B's specification and package B's body depends on package A's
specification).

#### notes

Pragma Elaborate_All controls the order of elaboration of one unit with
respect to another. This is another way of coupling units and should be
avoided when possible in reusable parts because it restricts the number
of configurations in which the reusable parts can be combined.
Recognize, however, that pragma Elaborate_All provides a better
guarantee of elaboration order because if using this pragma uncovers
elaboration problems, they will be reported at link time (as opposed to
a run-time execution error).

Any time you call a subprogram (typically a function) during the
elaboration of a library unit, the body of the subprogram must have been
elaborated before the library unit. You can ensure this elaboration
happens by adding a pragma Elaborate_Body for the unit containing the
function. If, however, that function calls other functions, then it is
safer to put a pragma Elaborate_All on the unit containing the
function.

For a discussion of the pragmas Pure and Preelaborate, see also the Ada
Reference Manual (1995, ยง10.2.1) and the Rationale (1995, ยง10.3). If you
use either pragma Pure or Preelaborate, you will not need the pragma
Elaborate_Body.

The idea of a registry is fundamental to many object-oriented
programming frameworks. Because other library units will need to call it
during their elaboration, you need to make sure that the registry itself
is elaborated early. Note that the registry should only depend on the
root types of the type hierarchies and that the registry should only
hold "class-wide" pointers to the objects, not more specific pointers.
The root types should not themselves depend on the registry. See Chapter
9 for a more complete discussion of the use of object-oriented features.

### Part Families

#### guideline

- Create families of generic or other parts with similar
  specifications.

#### example

The Booch parts (Booch 1987) are an example of the application of this
guideline.

#### rationale

Different versions of similar parts (e.g., bounded versus unbounded
stacks) may be needed for different applications or to change the
properties of a given application. Often, the different behaviors
required by these versions cannot be obtained using generic parameters.
Providing a family of parts with similar specifications makes it easy
for the programmer to select the appropriate one for the current
application or to substitute a different one if the needs of the
application change.

#### notes

A reusable part that is structured from subparts that are members of
part families is particularly easy to tailor to the needs of a given
application by substitution of family members.

Guideline 9.2.4 discusses the use of tagged types in building different
versions of similar parts (i.e., common interface, multiple
implementations).

### Conditional Compilation

#### guideline

- Structure reusable code to take advantage of dead code removal by
  the compiler.

#### example

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
package Matrix_Math is
   ...
   type Algorithm is (Gaussian, Pivoting, Choleski, Tri_Diagonal);
   generic
      Which_Algorithm : in     Algorithm := Gaussian;
   procedure Invert ( ... );
end Matrix_Math;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
package body Matrix_Math is
   ...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   procedure Invert ( ... ) is
      ...
   begin  -- Invert
      case Which_Algorithm is
         when Gaussian     => ... ;
         when Pivoting     => ... ;
         when Choleski     => ... ;
         when Tri_Diagonal => ... ;
      end case;
   end Invert;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
end Matrix_Math;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

Some compilers omit object code corresponding to parts of the program
that they detect can never be executed. Constant expressions in
conditional statements take advantage of this feature where it is
available, providing a limited form of conditional compilation. When a
part is reused in an implementation that does not support this form of
conditional compilation, this practice produces a clean structure that
is easy to adapt by deleting or commenting out redundant code where it
creates an unacceptable overhead.

This feature should be used when other factors prevent the code from
being separated into separate program units. In the above example, it
would be preferable to have a different procedure for each algorithm.
But the algorithms may differ in slight but complex ways to make
separate procedures difficult to maintain.

#### caution

Be aware of whether your implementation supports dead code removal, and
be prepared to take other steps to eliminate the overhead of redundant
code if necessary.

### Table-Driven Programming

#### guideline

- Write table-driven reusable parts wherever possible and appropriate.

#### example

The epitome of table-driven reusable software is a parser generation
system. A specification of the form of the input data and of its output,
along with some specialization code, is converted to tables that are to
be "walked" by preexisting code using predetermined algorithms in the
parser produced. Other forms of "application generators" work similarly.

#### rationale

Table-driven (sometimes known as data-driven) programs have behavior
that depends on data with'ed at compile time or read from a file at
run-time. In appropriate circumstances, table-driven programming
provides a very powerful way of creating general-purpose, easily
tailorable, reusable parts.

See Guideline 5.3.4 for a short discussion of using access-to-subprogram
types in implementing table-driven programs.

#### notes

Consider whether differences in the behavior of a general-purpose part
could be defined by some data structure at compile- or run-time, and if
so, structure the part to be table-driven. The approach is most likely
to be applicable when a part is designed for use in a particular
application domain but needs to be specialized for use in a specific
application within the domain. Take particular care in commenting the
structure of the data needed to drive the part.

Table-driven programs are often more efficient and easier to read than
the corresponding case or if-elsif-else networks to compute the item
being sought or looked up.

### String Handling

#### guideline

- Use the predefined packages for string handling.

#### example

Writing code such as the following is no longer necessary in Ada 95:

```ada
function Upper_Case (S : String) return String is

   subtype Lower_Case_Range is Character range 'a'..'z';

   Temp : String := S;
   Offset : constant := Character'Pos('A') - Character'Pos('a');

begin
   for Index in Temp'Range loop
      if Temp(Index) in Lower_Case_Range then
         Temp(Index) := Character'Val (Character'Pos(Temp(Index)) + Offset);
      end if;
   end loop;
   return Temp;
end Upper_Case;

with Ada.Characters.Latin_1;
function Trim (S : String) return String is
   Left_Index  : Positive := S'First;
   Right_Index : Positive := S'Last;
   Space : constant Character := Ada.Characters.Latin_1.Space;
begin
   while (Left_Index < S'Last) and then (S(Left_Index) = Space) loop
      Left_Index := Positive'Succ(Left_Index);
   end loop;

   while (Right_Index > S'First) and then (S(Right_Index) = Space) loop
      Right_Index := Positive'Pred(Right_Index);
   end loop;

   return S(Left_Index..Right_Index);
end Trim;
```

Assuming a variable S of type String, the following expression:

```ada
Upper_Case(Trim(S))
```

can now be replaced by more portable and preexisting language-defined
operations such as:

```ada
with Ada.Characters.Handling;  use Ada.Characters.Handling;
with Ada.Strings;              use Ada.Strings;
with Ada.Strings.Fixed;        use Ada.Strings.Fixed;

...
To_Upper (Trim (Source => S, Side => Both))
```

#### rationale

The predefined Ada language environment includes string handling
packages to encourage portability. They support different categories of
strings: fixed length, bounded length, and unbounded length. They also
support subprograms for string construction, concatenation, copying,
selection, ordering, searching, pattern matching, and string
transformation. You no longer need to define your own string handling
packages.

### Tagged Type Hierarchies

#### guideline

- Consider using hierarchies of tagged types to promote generalization
  of software for reuse.
- Consider using a tagged type hierarchy to decouple a generalized
  algorithm from the details of dependency on specific types.

#### example

```ada
with Wage_Info;
package Personnel is
   type Employee is abstract tagged limited private;
   type Employee_Ptr is access all Employee'Class;
   ...
   procedure Compute_Wage (E : Employee) is abstract;
private
   type Employee is tagged limited record
      Name  : ...;
      SSN   : ... ;
      Rates : Wage_Info.Tax_Info;
      ...
   end record;
end Personnel;
package Personnel.Part_Time is
   type Part_Timer is new Employee with private;
   ...
   procedure Compute_Wage (E : Part_Timer);
private
   ...
end Personnel.Part_Time;
package Personnel.Full_Time is
   type Full_Timer is new Employee with private;
   ...
   procedure Compute_Wage (E : Full_Timer);
private
   ...
end Personnel.Full_Time;
```

Given the following array declaration:

```ada
type Employee_List is array (Positive range <>) of Personnel.Employee_Ptr;
```

you can write a procedure that computes the wage of each employee,
regardless of the different types of employees that you create. The
Employee_List consists of an array of pointers to the various kinds of
employees, each of which has an individual Compute_Wage procedure. (The
primitive Compute_Wage is declared as an abstract procedure and,
therefore, must be overridden by all descendants.) You will not need to
modify the payroll code as you specialize the kinds of employees:

```ada
procedure Compute_Payroll (Who : Employee_List) is
begin -- Compute_Payroll
   for E in Who'Range loop
      Compute_Wage (Who(E).all);
   end loop;
end Compute_Payroll;
```

#### rationale

The general algorithm can depend polymorphically on objects of the
class-wide type of the root tagged type without caring what specialized
types are derived from the root type. The generalized algorithm does not
need to be changed if additional types are added to the type hierarchy.
See also Guideline 5.4.2. Furthermore, the child package hierarchy then
mirrors the inheritance hierarchy.

A general root tagged type can define the common properties and have
common operations for a hierarchy of more specific types. Software that
depends only on this root type will be general, in that it can be used
with objects of any of the more specific types. Further, the general
algorithms of clients of the root type do not have to be changed as more
specific types are added to the type hierarchy. This is a particularly
effective way to organize object-oriented software for reuse.

Separating the hierarchy of derived tagged types into individual
packages enhances reusability by reducing the number of items in package
interfaces. It also allows you to with only the capabilities needed.
