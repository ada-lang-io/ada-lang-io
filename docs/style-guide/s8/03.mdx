title: 8.3 Adaptability
---

Reusable parts often need to be changed before they can be used in a
specific application. They should be structured so that change is easy
and as localized as possible. One way of achieving adaptability is to
create general parts with complete functionality, only a subset of which
might be needed in a given application. Another way to achieve
adaptability is to use Ada's generic construct to produce parts that can
be appropriately instantiated with different parameters. Both of these
approaches avoid the error-prone process of adapting a part by changing
its code but have limitations and can carry some overhead. Anticipated
changes, that is, changes that can be reasonably foreseen by the
developer of the part, should be provided for as far as possible.
Unanticipated changes can only be accommodated by carefully structuring
a part to be adaptable. Many of the considerations pertaining to
maintainability apply. If the code is of high quality, clear, and
conforms to well-established design principles such as information
hiding, it is easier to adapt in unforeseen ways.

### Complete Functionality

#### guideline

- Provide core functionality in a reusable part or set of parts so
  that the functionality in this abstraction can be meaningfully
  extended by its reusers.
- More specifically, provide initialization and finalization
  procedures for every data structure that may contain dynamic data.
- For data structures needing initialization and finalization,
  consider deriving them, when possible, from the types
  Ada.Finalization.Controlled or Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled.

#### example

```ada
   Incoming : Queue;
   ...
   Set_Initial (Incoming);     -- initialization operation
   ...
   if Is_Full (Incoming) then  -- query operation
      ...
   end if;
   ...
   Clean_Up (Incoming);        -- finalization operation
```

#### rationale

This functionality is particularly important in designing/programming an
abstraction. You have to balance the completeness of the abstraction
against its extensibility. Completeness ensures that you have configured
the abstraction correctly, without built-in assumptions about its
execution environment. It also ensures the proper separation of
functions so that they are useful to the current application and, in
other combinations, to other applications. Extensibility ensures that
reusers can add functionality by extension, using tagged type
hierarchies (see Guideline 8.4.8 and Chapter 9) or child library
packages (see Guidelines 4.1.6, 8.4.1, and 9.4.1).

In designing for reuse, you need to think in terms of clean
abstractions. If you provide too little functionality and rely on your
reusers to extend the abstraction, they risk having an abstraction that
lacks cohesion. This hodgepodge abstraction has inherited many
operations, not all of which are necessary or work together.

When a reusable part can be implemented reasonably using dynamic data,
then any application that must control memory can use the initialization
and finalization routines to guard against memory leakage. Then, if data
structures become dynamic, the applications that are sensitive to these
concerns can be easily adapted.

The predefined types Ada.Finalization.Controlled or
Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled provide automatic, user-definable
initialization, adjustment, and finalization procedures. When you
declare controlled types and objects, you are guaranteed that the
compiler will insert the necessary calls to initialization, adjustment,
and finalization, making your code less error-prone and more
maintainable. When overriding the Initialize and Finalize routines on
the controlled types, make sure to call the parent Initialize or
Finalize.

#### notes

The example illustrates end condition functions. An abstraction should
be automatically initialized before its user gets a chance to damage it.
When that is not possible, it should be supplied with initialization
operations. In any case, it needs finalization operations. One way to
supply the initialization and finalization operations is to derive the
abstraction from the predefined types Ada.Finalization.Controlled or
Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled. Wherever possible, query
operations should be provided to determine when limits are about to be
exceeded, so that the user can avoid causing exceptions to be raised.

It is also useful to provide reset operations for many objects. To see
that a reset and an initiation can be different, consider the analogous
situation of a "warm boot" and a "cold boot" on a personal computer.

Even if all of these operations are not appropriate for the abstraction,
the exercise of considering them aids in formulating a complete set of
operations, others of which may be used by another application.

Some implementations of the language link all subprograms of a package
into the executable file, ignoring whether they are used or not, making
unused operations a liability (see Guideline 8.4.5). In such cases,
where the overhead is significant, create a copy of the fully functional
part and comment out the unused operations with an indication that they
are redundant in this application.

### Generic Units

#### guideline

- Use generic units to avoid code duplication.
- Parameterize generic units for maximum adaptability.
- Reuse common instantiations of generic units, as well as the generic
  units themselves.

#### rationale

Ada does not allow data types to be passed as actual parameters to
subprograms during execution. Such parameters must be specified as
generic formal parameters to a generic unit when it is instantiated.
Therefore, if you want to write a subprogram for which there is
variation from call to call in the data type of objects on which it
operates, then you must write the subprogram as a generic unit and
instantiate it once for each combination of data type parameters. The
instantiations of the unit can then be called as regular subprograms.

You can pass subprograms as actual parameters either by declaring
access-to-subprogram values or generic formal subprogram parameters. See
Guideline 5.3.4 for a discussion of the tradeoffs.

If you find yourself writing two very similar routines differing only in
the data type they operate on or the subprograms they call, then it is
probably better to write the routine once as a generic unit and
instantiate it twice to get the two versions you need. When the need
arises later to modify the two routines, the change only needs to be
made in one place. This greatly facilitates maintenance.

Once you have made such a choice, consider other aspects of the routine
that these two instances may have in common but that are not essential
to the nature of the routine. Factor these out as generic formal
parameters. When the need arises later for a third similar routine, it
can be automatically produced by a third instantiation if you have
foreseen all the differences between it and the other two. A
parameterized generic unit can be very reusable.

It may seem that the effort involved in writing generic rather than
nongeneric units is substantial. However, making units generic is not
much more difficult or time-consuming than making them nongeneric once
you become familiar with the generic facilities. It is, for the most
part, a matter of practice. Also, any effort put into the development of
the unit will be recouped when the unit is reused, as it surely will be
if it is placed in a reuse library with sufficient visibility. Do not
limit your thinking about potential reuse to the application you are
working on or to other applications with which you are very familiar.
Applications with which you are not familiar or future applications
might be able to reuse your software.

After writing a generic unit and placing it in your reuse library, the
first thing you are likely to do is to instantiate it once for your
particular needs. At this time, it is a good idea to consider whether
there are instantiations that are very likely to be widely used. If so,
place each such instantiation in your reuse library so that they can be
found and shared by others.

See also Guideline 9.3.5.

### Formal Private and Limited Private Types

#### guideline

- Consider using a limited private type for a generic formal type when
  you do not need assignment on objects of the type inside the generic
  body.
- Consider using a nonlimited private type for a generic formal type
  when you need normal assignment on objects of the type inside the
  body of the generic.
- Consider using a formal tagged type derived from
  Ada.Finalization.Controlled when you need to enforce special
  assignment semantics on objects of the type in the body of the
  generic.
- Export the least restrictive type that maintains the integrity of
  the data and abstraction while allowing alternate implementations.
- Consider using a limited private abstract type for generic formal
  types of a generic that extends a formal private tagged type.

#### example

The first example shows a case of a template providing only a data
structure, a case in which assignment is clearly not needed in the body
of the generic:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   type Element_Type is limited private;
package Generic_Doubly_Linked_Lists is
   type Cell_Type;
   type List_Type is access all Element_Type;
   type Cell_Type is
      record
         Data     : Element_Type;
         Next     : List_Type;
         Previous : List_Type;
      end record;
end Generic_Doubly_Linked_Lists;
```

The second example shows a template that composes new operations out of
(nonassignment) operations passed as generic formal parameters:

```ada
generic
   type Element_Type is limited private;
   with procedure Process_Element (X : in out Element_Type);
   type List_Type is array (Positive range <>) of Element_Type;
procedure Process_List (L : in out List_Type);
procedure Process_List (L : in out List_Type) is
begin -- Process_List
   for I in L'Range loop
      Process_Element (L(I));
   end loop;
end Process_List;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   type Domain_Type is limited private;
   type Intermediate_Type is limited private;
   type Range_Type is limited private;
   with function Left (X : Intermediate_Type) return Range_Type;
   with function Right (X : Domain_Type) return Intermediate_Type;
function Generic_Composition (X : Domain_Type) return Range_Type;
-- the function Left o Right
function Generic_Composition (X : Domain_Type) return Range_Type is
begin  -- generic_Composition
   return Left (Right (X));
end Generic_Composition;
```

The third example shows how to use Ada's controlled types to provide
special assignment semantics:

```ada
with Ada.Finalization;
generic
   type Any_Element is new Ada.Finalization.Controlled with private;
   Maximum_Stack_Size : in Natural := 100;
package Bounded_Stack is
   type Stack is private;
   procedure Push (On_Top      : in out Stack;
                   New_Element : in     Any_Element);
   procedure Pop  (From_Top    : in out Stack;
                   Top_Element :    out Any_Element);
   Overflow  : exception;
   Underflow : exception;
   ...
private
   type Stack_Information;
   type Stack is access Stack_Information;
end Bounded_Stack;
```

#### rationale

For a generic component to be usable in as many contexts as possible, it
should minimize the assumptions that it makes about its environment and
should make explicit any assumptions that are necessary. In Ada, the
assumptions made by generic units can be stated explicitly by the types
of the generic formal parameters. A limited private generic formal type
prevents the generic unit from making any assumptions about the
structure of objects of the type or about operations defined for such
objects. A private (nonlimited) generic formal type allows the
assumption that assignment and equality comparison operations are
defined for the type. Thus, a limited private data type cannot be
specified as the actual parameter for a private generic formal type.

In general, you should choose the private or limited private generic
formal type based on the need for assignment inside a generic. Limited
private types should be used for abstractions that do not need
assignment, as in the first two examples above. In the third example,
where assignment is needed, a type derived from a controlled type is
specified to ensure that the correct assignment semantics will be
available. If you need equality in the body of the generic, you may need
to redefine equality as well to get the correct semantics; you would
then need to include a formal generic subprogram parameter for the =
function.

The situation is reversed for types exported by a reusable part. For
exported types, the restrictions specified by limited and limited
private are restrictions on the user of the part, not on the part
itself. To provide maximum capability to the user of a reusable part,
export types with as few restrictions as possible. Apply restrictions as
necessary to protect the integrity of the exported data structures and
the abstraction for the various implementations envisioned for that
generic.

Because they are so restrictive, limited private types are not always
the best choice for types exported by a reusable part. In a case where
it makes sense to allow the user to make copies of and compare data
objects, and when the underlying data type does not involve access types
(so that the entire data structure gets copied or compared), then it is
better to export a (nonlimited) private type. In a case where it makes
sense to allow the user to make copies of and compare data objects and
when the underlying data type involves access types (so that the entire
data structure gets copied or compared), then it is better to export a
controlled type and an (overridden) equality operation. In cases where
it does not detract from the abstraction to reveal even more about the
type, then a nonprivate type (e.g., a numeric, enumerated, record, or
array type) should be used.

One use of generic units is to create a mixin generic (see Guideline
8.3.8) to extend a tagged type. In this situation, you want to use the
most restrictive type as the generic formal type, that is, a formal type
that is both limited and abstract. When you instantiate the generic, if
the actual type is nonlimited, the type extension will also be
nonlimited. In the generic package, you must declare the type extension
as abstract. The instantiator of the generic can then extend the type
again to achieve the desired mixin configuration.

#### notes

The predefined packages, Sequential_IO and Direct_IO, take private
types. This will complicate I/O requirements for limited private types
and should be considered during design.

There are also some cases where you must use a limited private formal
type. These cases arise when the formal type has an access discriminant,
or the formal is used as the parent type in defining a type extension
that itself includes a component of a limited type (e.g., task type), or
the formal defines a new discriminant part with an access discriminant.

### Using Generic Units to Encapsulate Algorithms

#### guideline

- Use generic units to encapsulate algorithms independently of data
  type.

#### example

This is the specification of a generic sort procedure:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   type Element is private;
   type Data    is array (Positive range <>) of Element;
   with function Should_Precede (Left  : in     Element;
                                 Right : in     Element)
          return Boolean is <>;
 with procedure Swap (Left  : in out Element;
                        Right : in out Element) is <>;
procedure Generic_Sort (Data_To_Sort : in out Data);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The generic body looks just like a regular procedure body and can make
full use of the generic formal parameters in implementing the sort
algorithm:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
procedure Generic_Sort (Data_To_Sort : in out Data) is
begin
   ...
   for I in Data_To_Sort'Range loop
      ...
         ...
         if Should_Precede (Data_To_Sort(J), Data_To_Sort(I)) then
            Swap(Data_To_Sort(I), Data_To_Sort(J));
         end if;
         ...
      ...
   end loop;
   ...
end Generic_Sort;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The generic procedure can be instantiated as:

```ada
   type Integer_Array is array (Positive range <>) of Integer;
   function Should_Precede (Left  : in     Integer;
                            Right : in     Integer)
     return Boolean;

   procedure Swap (Left  : in out Integer;
                   Right : in out Integer);
   procedure Sort is
      new Generic_Sort (Element => Integer,
                        Data    => Integer_Array);
```

or:

```ada
   subtype String_80    is String (1 .. 80);
   type    String_Array is array (Positive range <>) of String_80;
   function Should_Precede (Left  : in     String_80;
                            Right : in     String_80)
     return Boolean;

   procedure Swap (Left  : in out String_80;
                   Right : in out String_80);

   procedure Sort is
      new Generic_Sort (Element => String_80,
                        Data    => String_Array);
```

and called as:

```ada
   Integer_Array_1 : Integer_Array (1 .. 100);
   ...
   Sort (Integer_Array_1);
```

or:

```ada
   String_Array_1  : String_Array  (1 .. 100);
   ...
   Sort (String_Array_1);
```

#### rationale

A sort algorithm can be described independently of the data type being
sorted. This generic procedure takes the Element data type as a generic
limited private type parameter so that it assumes as little as possible
about the data type of the objects actually being operated on. It also
takes Data as a generic formal parameter so that instantiations can have
entire arrays passed to them for sorting. Finally, it explicitly
requires the two operators that it needs to do the sort: Should_Precede
and Swap. The sort algorithm is encapsulated without reference to any
data type. The generic can be instantiated to sort an array of any data
type. 8.3.5 Using Generic Units for Data Abstraction

#### guideline

- Consider using abstract data types (not to be confused with Ada's
  abstract types) in preference to abstract data objects.
- Consider using generic units to implement abstract data types
  independently of their component data type.

#### example

This example presents a series of different techniques that can be used
to generate abstract data types and objects. A discussion of the merits
of each follows in the rationale section below. The first is an abstract
data object (ADO), which can be used to encapsulate an abstract state
machine. It encapsulates one stack of integers:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
package Bounded_Stack is
   subtype Element is Integer;
   Maximum_Stack_Size : constant := 100;
   procedure Push (New_Element : in     Element);
   procedure Pop  (Top_Element :    out Element);
   Overflow  : exception;
   Underflow : exception;
   ...
end Bounded_Stack;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The second example is an abstract data type (ADT). It differs from the
ADO by exporting the Stack type, which allows the user to declare any
number of stacks of integers. Because multiple stacks may now exist, it
is necessary to specify a Stack argument on calls to Push and Pop:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
package Bounded_Stack is
   subtype Element is Integer;
   type    Stack   is limited private;
   Maximum_Stack_Size : constant := 100;
   procedure Push (On_Top      : in out Stack;
                   New_Element : in     Element);
   procedure Pop  (From_Top    : in out Stack;
                   Top_Element :    out Element);
   Overflow  : exception;
   Underflow : exception;
   ...
private
   type Stack_Information;
   type Stack is access Stack_Information;
end Bounded_Stack;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The third example is a parameterless generic abstract data object
(GADO). It differs from the ADO (the first example) simply by being
generic, so that the user can instantiate it multiple times to obtain
multiple stacks of integers:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
package Bounded_Stack is
   subtype Element is Integer;
   Maximum_Stack_Size : constant := 100;
   procedure Push (New_Element : in     Element);
   procedure Pop  (Top_Element :    out Element);
   Overflow  : exception;
   Underflow : exception;
   ...
end Bounded_Stack;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The fourth example is a slight variant on the third, still a GADO but
with parameters. It differs from the third example by making the data
type of the stack a generic parameter so that stacks of data types other
than Integer can be created. Also, Maximum_Stack_Size has been made a
generic parameter that defaults to 100 but can be specified by the user,
rather than a constant defined by the package:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   type Element is private;
   Maximum_Stack_Size : in Natural := 100;
package Bounded_Stack is
   procedure Push (New_Element : in     Element);
   procedure Pop  (Top_Element :    out Element);
   Overflow  : exception;
   Underflow : exception;
   ...
end Bounded_Stack;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The fifth example is a generic abstract data type (GADT). It differs
from the GADO in the fourth example in the same way that the ADT in the
second example differed from the ADO in the first example; it exports
the Stack type, which allows the user to declare any number of stacks:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   type Element is private;
   Maximum_Stack_Size : in Natural := 100;
package Bounded_Stack is
   type Stack is private;
   procedure Push (On_Top      : in out Stack;
                   New_Element : in     Element);
   procedure Pop  (From_Top    : in out Stack;
                   Top_Element :    out Element);
   Overflow  : exception;
   Underflow : exception;
   ...
private
   type Stack_Information;
   type Stack is access Stack_Information;
end Bounded_Stack;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

The biggest advantage of an ADT over an ADO (or a GADT over a GADO) is
that the user of the package can declare as many objects as desired with
an ADT. These objects can be declared as standalone variables or as
components of arrays and records. They can also be passed as parameters.
None of this is possible with an ADO, where the single data object is
encapsulated inside of the package. Furthermore, an ADO provides no more
protection of the data structure than an ADT. When a private type is
exported by the ADT package, as in the example above, then for both the
ADO and ADT, the only legal operations that can modify the data are
those defined explicitly by the package (in this case, Push and Pop).
For these reasons, an ADT or GADT is almost always preferable to an ADO
or GADO, respectively.

A GADO is similar to an ADT in one way: it allows multiple objects to be
created by the user. With an ADT, multiple objects can be declared using
the type defined by the ADT package. With a GADO (even a GADO with no
generic formal parameters, as shown in the third example), the package
can be instantiated multiple times to produce multiple objects. However,
the similarity ends there. The multiple objects produced by the
instantiations suffer from all restrictions described above for ADOs;
they cannot be used in arrays or records or passed as parameters.
Furthermore, the objects are each of a different type, and no operations
are defined to operate on more than one of them at a time. For example,
there cannot be an operation to compare two such objects or to assign
one to another. The multiple objects declared using the type defined by
an ADT package suffer from no such restrictions; they can be used in
arrays and records and can be passed as parameters. Also, they are all
declared to be of the same type, so that it is possible for the ADT
package to provide operations to assign, compare, copy, etc. For these
reasons, an ADT is almost always preferable to a parameterless GADO.

The biggest advantage of a GADT or GADO over an ADT or ADO,
respectively, is that the GADT and GADO are generic and can thus be
parameterized with types, subprograms, and other configuration
information. Thus, as shown above, a single generic package can support
bounded stacks of any data type and any stack size, while the ADT and
ADO above are restricted to stacks of Integer, no more than 100 in size.
For this reason, a GADO or GADT is almost always preferable to an ADO or
ADT.

The list of examples above is given in order of increasing power and
flexibility, starting with an ADO and ending with a GADT. These
advantages are not expensive in terms of complexity or development time.
The specification of the GADT above is not significantly harder to write
or understand than the specification of the ADO. The bodies are also
nearly identical.

Compare the body for the simplest version, the ADO:

---

package body Bounded_Stack is

` type Stack_Slots is array (Natural range <>) of Element;`  
` type Stack_Information is`  
` record`  
` Slots : Stack_Slots (1 .. Maximum_Stack_Size);`  
` Index : Natural := 0;`  
` end record;`  
` Stack : Stack_Information;`  
` ---------------------------------------------------------------------`  
` procedure Push (New_Element : in Element) is`  
` begin`  
` if Stack.Index >= Maximum_Stack_Size then`  
` raise Overflow;`  
` end if;`  
` Stack.Index := Stack.Index + 1;`  
` Stack.Slots(Stack.Index) := New_Element;`  
` end Push;`  
` ---------------------------------------------------------------------`  
` procedure Pop (Top_Element : out Element) is`  
` begin`  
` if Stack.Index <= 0 then`  
` raise Underflow;`  
` end if;`  
` Top_Element := Stack.Slots(Stack.Index);`  
` Stack.Index := Stack.Index - 1;`  
` end Pop;`  
` ---------------------------------------------------------------------`  
` ...`

end Bounded_Stack;

---

with the body for the most powerful and flexible version, the GADT:

---

package body Bounded_Stack is

` type Stack_Slots is array (Natural range <>) of Element;`  
` type Stack_Information is`  
` record`  
` Slots : Stack_Slots (1 .. Maximum_Stack_Size);`  
` Index : Natural := 0;`  
` end record;`  
` ---------------------------------------------------------------------`  
` procedure Push (On_Top : in out Stack;`  
` New_Element : in Element) is`  
` begin`  
` if On_Top.Index >= Maximum_Stack_Size then`  
` raise Overflow;`  
` end if;`  
` On_Top.Index := On_Top.Index + 1;`  
` On_Top.Slots(On_Top.Index) := New_Element;`  
` end Push;`  
` ---------------------------------------------------------------------`  
` procedure Pop (From_Top : in out Stack;`  
` Top_Element : out Element) is`  
` begin`  
` if From_Top.Index <= 0 then`  
` raise Underflow;`  
` end if;`  
` Top_Element := From_Top.Slots(From_Top.Index);`

` From_Top.Index := From_Top.Index - 1;`  
` end Pop;`  
` ---------------------------------------------------------------------`  
` ...`

end Bounded_Stack;

---

There is only one difference. The ADO declares a local object called
Stack, while the GADT has one additional parameter (called Stack) on
each of the exported procedures Push and Pop.

### Iterators

#### guideline

- Provide iterators for traversing complex data structures within
  reusable parts.
- Consider providing both active and passive iterators.
- Protect the iterators from errors due to modification of the data
  structure during iteration.
- Document the behavior of the iterators when the data structure is
  modified during traversal.

#### example

Ada provides several mechanisms for building reusable iterators. The
following examples discuss the alternatives of "simple" generics, access
discriminants, and type extension. The terms active and passive are used
to differentiate whether the iteration mechanism (i.e., the way in which
the complex data structure is traversed) is exposed or hidden. A passive
iterator hides the traversal (e.g., looping mechanism) and consists of a
single operation, iterate, that is parameterized by the processing you
do on each element of the data structure. By contrast, an active
iterator exposes the primitive operations by which you traverse the data
structure (Booch 1987).

The first example shows a generic package that defines an abstract list
data type, with both active and passive iterators for traversing a list:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   type Element is limited private;
   ...
package Unbounded_List is
   type List is limited private;
   procedure Insert (New_Element : in     Element;
                     Into        : in out List);
   -- Passive (generic) iterator.
   generic
      with procedure Process (Each : in out Element);
   procedure Iterate (Over : in     List);
   -- Active iterator
   type Iterator is limited private;

   procedure Initialize (Index         : in out Iterator;
                         Existing_List : in     List);

   function  More       (Index         : in     Iterator)
     return Boolean;

   -- The procedure Get_Next combines an "Advance" and "Current" function
   procedure Get_Next   (Index           : in out Iterator;
                         Current_Element :    out Element);
   ...
private
   ...
end Unbounded_List;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

After instantiating the generic package and declaring a list as:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Unbounded_List;
procedure List_User is
   type Employee is ...;
   package Roster is
      new Unbounded_List (Element => Employee, ...);
   Employee_List : Roster.List;
```

the passive iterator is instantiated, specifying the name of the routine
that should be called for each list element when the iterator is called.

```ada
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   procedure Process_Employee (Each : in out Employee) is
   begin
      ...
      -- Perform the required action for EMPLOYEE here.
   end Process_Employee;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   procedure Process_All is
      new Roster.Iterate (Process => Process_Employee);
```

The passive iterator can then be called as:

```ada
begin  -- List_User
   Process_All (Employee_List);
end List_User;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Alternatively, the active iterator can be used without the second
instantiation required by the passive iterator:

```ada
   Iterator         : Roster.Iterator;
   Current_Employee : Employee;
   procedure Process_Employee (Each : in     Employee) is separate;
begin  -- List_User
   Roster.Initialize (Index         => Iterator,
                      Existing_List => Employee_List);

   while Roster.More (Iterator) loop

      Roster.Get_Next (Index           => Iterator,
                       Current_Element => Current_Employee);

      Process_Employee (Current_Employee);

   end loop;
end List_User;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The second example shows a code excerpt from Rationale (1995, §3.7.1) on
how to construct iterators using access discriminants:

```ada
generic
   type Element is private;
package Sets is
   type Set is limited private;
   ... -- various set operations
   type Iterator (S : access Set) is limited private;
   procedure Start (I : Iterator);
   function Done (I : Iterator) return Boolean;
   procedure Next (I : in out Iterator);
   ...  -- other iterator operations
private
   type Node;
   type Ptr is access Node;
   type Node is
      record
         E    : Element;
         Next : Ptr;
      end record;
   type Set is new Ptr;
   type Iterator (S : access Set) is
      record
         This : Ptr;
      end record;
end Sets;
package body Sets is
   ...  -- bodies of the various set operations
   procedure Start (I : in out Iterator) is
   begin
      I.This := Ptr(I.S.all);
   end Start;
   function Done (I : Iterator) return Boolean is
   begin
      return I.This = null;
   end Done;
   procedure Next (I : in out Iterator) is
   begin
      I.This := I.This.Next;
   end Next;
   ...
end Sets;
```

The iterator operations allow you to iterate over the elements of the
set with the component This of the iterator object accessing the current
element. The access discriminant always points to the enclosing set to
which the current element belongs.

The third example uses code fragments from Rationale (1995, §4.4.4) to
show an iterator using type extension and dispatching:

```ada
type Element is ...
package Sets is
   type Set is limited private;
   -- various set operations
   type Iterator is abstract tagged null record;
   procedure Iterate (S : in Set; IC : in out Iterator'Class);
   procedure Action (E : in out Element;
                     I : in out Iterator) is abstract;
private
   -- definition of Node, Ptr (to Node), and Set
end Sets;
package body Sets is
   ...
   procedure Iterate (S : in Set; IC : in out Iterator'Class) is
      This : Ptr := Ptr (S);
   begin
      while This /= null loop
         Action (This.E, IC);  -- dispatch
         This := This.Next;
      end loop;
   end Iterate;
end Sets;
```

The general purpose iterator looks like this:

```ada
package Sets.Something is
   procedure Do_Something (S : Set; P : Parameters);
end Sets.Something;
package body Sets.Something is
   type My_Iterator is new Iterator with
      record
         -- components for parameters and workspace
      end record;
   procedure Action (E : in out Element;
                     I : in out My_Iterator) is
   begin
      -- do something to element E using data from iterator I
   end Action;
   procedure Do_Something (S : Set; P : Parameters) is
      I : My_Iterator;
   begin  -- Do_Something
      ...  -- copy parameters into iterator
      Iterate (S, I);
      ... copy any results from iterator back to parameters
   end Do_Something;

end Sets.Something;
```

#### rationale

Iteration over complex data structures is often required and, if not
provided by the part itself, can be difficult to implement without
violating information hiding principles.

Active and passive iterators each have their advantages, but neither is
appropriate in all situations. Therefore, it is recommended that both be
provided to give the user a choice of which to use in each situation.

Passive iterators are simpler and less error-prone than active
iterators, in the same way that the for loop is simpler and less
error-prone than the while loop. There are fewer mistakes that the user
can make in using a passive iterator. Simply instantiate it with the
routine to be executed for each list element, and call the instantiation
for the desired list. Active iterators require more care by the user.
Care must be taken to invoke the iterator operations in the proper
sequence and to associate the proper iterator variable with the proper
list variable. It is possible for a change made to the software during
maintenance to introduce an error, perhaps an infinite loop.

On the other hand, active iterators are more flexible than passive
iterators. With a passive iterator, it is difficult to perform multiple,
concurrent, synchronized iterations. For example, it is much easier to
use active iterators to iterate over two sorted lists, merging them into
a third sorted list. Also, for multidimensional data structures, a small
number of active iterator routines may be able to replace a large number
of passive iterators, each of which implements one combination of the
active iterators. Finally, active iterators can be passed as generic
formal parameters while passive iterators cannot because passive
iterators are themselves generic, and generic units cannot be passed as
parameters to other generic units.

For either type of iterator, semantic questions can arise about what
happens when the data structure is modified as it is being iterated.
When writing an iterator, be sure to consider this possibility, and
indicate with comments the behavior that occurs in such a case. It is
not always obvious to the user what to expect. For example, to determine
the "closure" of a mathematical "set" with respect to some operation, a
common algorithm is to iterate over the members of the set, generating
new elements and adding them to the set. In such a case, it is important
that elements added to the set during the iteration be encountered
subsequently during the iteration. On the other hand, for other
algorithms, it may be important that the iterated set is the same set
that existed at the beginning of the iteration. In the case of a
prioritized list data structure, if the list is iterated in priority
order, it may be important that elements inserted at lower priority than
the current element during iteration not be encountered subsequently
during the iteration but that elements inserted at a higher priority
should be encountered. In any case, make a conscious decision about how
the iterator should operate, and document that behavior in the package
specification.

Deletions from the data structure also pose a problem for iterators. It
is a common mistake for a user to iterate over a data structure,
deleting it piece by piece during the iteration. If the iterator is not
prepared for such a situation, it is possible to end up dereferencing a
null pointer or committing a similar error. Such situations can be
prevented by storing extra information with each data structure, which
indicates whether it is currently being iterated, and using this
information to disallow any modifications to the data structure during
iteration. When the data structure is declared as a limited private
type, as should usually be the case when iterators are involved, the
only operations defined on the type are declared explicitly in the
package that declares the type, making it possible to add such tests to
all modification operations.

The Rationale (1995, §4.4.4) notes that the access discriminant and type
extension techniques are inversions of each other. In the access
discriminant approach, you have to write out the looping mechanism for
each action. In the type extension approach, you write one loop and
dispatch to the desired action. Thus, an iterator that uses the access
discriminant technique would be considered active, while an iterator
that uses the type extension technique would be considered passive.

#### notes

You can use an access to subprogram type as an alternative to generic
instantiation, using a nongeneric parameter as a pointer to subprogram.
You would then apply the referenced subprogram to every element in a
collection ( Rationale 1995, §3.7.2). There are drawbacks to this
approach, however, because you cannot use it to create a general purpose
iterator. Anonymous access to subprogram parameters is not allowed in
Ada; thus, the following fragment is illegal:

```ada
procedure Iterate (C      : Collection;
                   Action : access procedure (E : in out Element));
```

The formal parameter Action must be of a named access subtype, as in:

```ada
type Action_Type is access procedure (E : in out Element);
procedure Iterate (C      : Collection;
                   Action : Action_Type);
```

In order for this to work, you must make sure that the action subprogram
is in scope and not defined internal to another subprogram. If it is
defined as a nested procedure, it would be illegal to access it. See the
Rationale (1995, §4.4.4) for a more complete example.

For further discussion of passive and active iterators, see the
Rationale (1995, §3.7.1 and §4.4.4), Ross (1989), and Booch (1987).

### Decimal Type Output and Information Systems Annex

#### guideline

- Localize the currency symbol, digits separator, radix mark, and fill
  character in picture output.
- Consider using the \# character in picture layouts so that the
  edited numeric output lengths are invariant across currency symbols
  of different lengths.

#### example

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO.Editing;
package Currency is

   type Dollars is delta 0.01 digits 10;
   type Marks   is delta 0.01 digits 10;

   package Dollar_Output is
      new Ada.Text_IO.Editing.Decimal_Output
             (Num                => Dollars,
              Default_Currency   => "$",
              Default_Fill       => '*',
              Default_Separator  => ',',
              Default_Radix_Mark => '.');

   package Mark_Output is
      new Ada.Text_IO.Editing.Decimal_Output
             (Num                => Marks,
              Default_Currency   => "DM",
              Default_Fill       => '*',
              Default_Separator  => '.',
              Default_Radix_Mark => ',');

end Currency;
with Ada.Text_IO.Editing;
with Currency;  use Currency;
procedure Test_Picture_Editing is

   DM_Amount     : Marks;
   Dollar_Amount : Dollars;

   Amount_Picture : constant Ada.Text_IO.Editing.Picture
      := Ada.Text_IO.Editing.To_Picture ("##ZZ_ZZZ_ZZ9.99");

begin   -- Test_Picture_Editing

   DM_Amount     := 1_234_567.89;
   Dollar_Amount := 1_234_567.89;

   DM_Output.Put (Item => DM_Amount,
                  Pic  => Amount_Picture);

   Dollar_Output.Put (Item => Dollar_Amount,
                      Pic  => Amount_Picture);

end Test_Picture_Editing;
```

#### rationale

Currencies differ in how they are displayed in a report. Currencies use
different symbols of different lengths (e.g., the American $, the German
DM, and the Austrian ÖS). They use different symbols to separate digits.
The United States and the United Kingdom use the comma to separate
groups of thousands, whereas Continental Europe uses the period. The
United States and the United Kingdom use a period as a decimal point;
Continental Europe uses the comma. For a program involving financial
calculations that is to be reused across countries, you need to take
these differences into account. By encapsulating them, you limit the
impact of change in adapting the financial package.

### Implementing Mixins

#### guideline

- Consider using abstract tagged types and generics to define reusable
  units of functionality that can be "mixed into" core abstractions
  (also known as mixins).

#### example

Note the use of an abstract tagged type as a generic formal parameter
and as the exported extended type in the pattern that follows, excerpted
from the Rationale (1995, §4.6.2):

```ada
generic
   type S is abstract tagged private;
package P is
   type T is abstract new S with private;
   -- operations on T
private
   type T is abstract new S with
      record
         -- additional components
      end record;
end P;
```

The following code shows how the generic might be instantiated to
"mixin" the desired features in the final type extension. See also
Guideline 9.5.1 for a related example of code.

```ada
-- Assume that packages P1, P2, P3, and P4 are generic packages which take a tagged
-- type as generic formal type parameter and which export a tagged type T
package Q is
   type My_T is new Basic_T with private;
   ... -- exported operations
private
   package Feature_1 is new P1 (Basic_T);
   package Feature_2 is new P2 (Feature_1.T);
   package Feature 3 is new P3 (Feature_2.T);
   package Feature_4 is new P4 (Feature_3.T);
   -- etc.
   type My_T is new Feature_4.T with null record;
end Q;
```

#### rationale

The Rationale (1995, §4.6.2) discusses the use of a generic template to
define the properties to be mixed in to your abstraction:

The generic template defines the mixin. The type supplied as generic
actual parameter determines the parent . . . the body provides the
operations and the specification exports the extended type.

If you have defined a series of generic mixin packages, you would then
serialize the instantiations. The actual parameter to the next
instantiation is the exported tagged type from the previous
instantiation. This is shown in the second code segment in the example.
Each extension is derived from a previous extension, so you have a
linearized succession of overriding subprograms. Because they are
linearized, you have a derivation order you can use to resolve any
conflicts.

You should encapsulate one extension (and related operations) per
generic package. This provides a better separation of concerns and more
maintainable, reusable components.

See Guideline 9.5.1 for a full discussion of the use of mixins.
