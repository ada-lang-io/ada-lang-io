title: 8.1 Understanding and Clarity
---

It is particularly important that parts intended for reuse should be
easy to understand. What the part does, how to use it, what anticipated
changes might be made to it in the future, and how it works are facts
that must be immediately apparent from inspection of the comments and
the code itself. For maximum readability of reusable parts, follow the
guidelines in Chapter 3, some of which are repeated more strongly below.

### Application-Independent Naming

#### guideline

- Select the least restrictive names possible for reusable parts and
  their identifiers .
- Select the generic name to avoid conflicting with the naming
  conventions of instantiations of the generic.
- Use names that indicate the behavioral characteristics of the
  reusable part, as well as its abstraction.

#### example

General-purpose stack abstraction:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   type Item is private;
package Bounded_Stack is
   procedure Push (New_Item    : in     Item);
   procedure Pop  (Newest_Item :    out Item);
   ...
end Bounded_Stack;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Renamed appropriately for use in current application:

```ada
with Bounded_Stack;

...

   type Tray is ...
   package Tray_Stack is
      new Bounded_Stack (Item => Tray);
```

#### rationale

Choosing a general or application-independent name for a reusable part
encourages its wide reuse. When the part is used in a specific context,
it can be instantiated (if generic) or renamed with a more specific
name.

When there is an obvious choice for the simplest, clearest name for a
reusable part, it is a good idea to leave that name for use by the
reuser of the part, choosing a longer, more descriptive name for the
reusable part. Thus, Bounded_Stack is a better name than Stack for a
generic stack package because it leaves the simpler name Stack available
to be used by an instantiation.

Include indications of the behavioral characteristics (but not
indications of the implementation) in the name of a reusable part so
that multiple parts with the same abstraction (e.g., multiple stack
packages) but with different restrictions (bounded, unbounded, etc.) can
be stored in the same Ada library and used as part of the same Ada
program.

### Abbreviations

#### guideline

- Do not use abbreviations in identifier or unit names.

#### example

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Ada.Calendar;
package Greenwich_Mean_Time is
   function Clock return Ada.Calendar.Time;
   ...
end Greenwich_Mean_Time;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The following abbreviation may not be clear when used in an application:

```ada
with Ada.Calendar;
with Greenwich_Mean_Time;
...
   function Get_GMT return Ada.Calendar.Time renames
          Greenwich_Mean_Time.Clock;
```

#### rationale

This is a stronger guideline than Guideline 3.1.4. However well
commented, an abbreviation may cause confusion in some future reuse
context. Even universally accepted abbreviations, such as GMT for
Greenwich Mean Time, can cause problems and should be used only with
great caution.

The difference between this guideline and Guideline 3.1.4 involves
issues of domain. When the domain is well-defined, abbreviations and
acronyms that are accepted in that domain will clarify the meaning of
the application. When that same code is removed from its domain-specific
context, those abbreviations may become meaningless.

In the example above, the package, Greenwich_Mean_Time, could be used
in any application without loss of meaning. But the function Get_GMT
could easily be confused with some other acronym in a different domain.

#### notes

See Guideline 5.7.2 concerning the proper use of the renames clause. If
a particular application makes extensive use of the
Greenwich_Mean_Time domain, it may be appropriate to rename the
package GMT within that application:

with Greenwich_Mean_Time; ...

` package GMT renames Greenwich_Mean_Time;`

### Generic Formal Parameters

#### guideline

- Document the expected behavior of generic formal parameters just as
  you document any package specification.

#### example

The following example shows how a very general algorithm can be
developed but must be clearly documented to be used:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   -- Index provides access to values in a structure.  For example,
   -- an array, A.
   type Index is (<>);
   type Element is private;
   type Element_Array is array (Index range <>) of Element;
   -- The function, Should_Precede, does NOT compare the indexes
   -- themselves; it compares the elements of the structure.
   -- The function Should_Precede is provided rather than a "Less_Than" function
   -- because the sort criterion need not be smallest first.
   with function Should_Precede (Left  : in     Element;
                                 Right : in     Element)
     return Boolean;
   -- This procedure swaps values of the structure (the mode won't
   -- allow the indexes themselves to be swapped!)
   with procedure Swap (Index1 : in     Index;
                        Index2 : in     Index;
                        A      : in out Element_Array);
   -- After the call to Quick_Sort, the indexed structure will be
   -- sorted:
   --     For all i,j in First..Last :  i<j  =>  A(i) < A(j).
procedure Quick_Sort (First : in     Index := Index'First;
                      Last  : in     Index := Index'Last);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

The generic capability is one of Ada's strongest features because of its
formalization. However, not all of the assumptions made about generic
formal parameters can be expressed directly in Ada. It is important that
any user of a generic know exactly what that generic needs in order to
behave correctly.

In a sense, a generic specification is a contract where the instantiator
must supply the formal parameters and, in return, receives a working
instance of the specification. Both parties are best served when the
contract is complete and clear about all assumptions.
