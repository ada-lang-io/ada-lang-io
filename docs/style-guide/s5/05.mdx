title: 5.5 Expressions
---

Properly coded expressions can enhance the readability and
understandability of a program. Poorly coded expressions can turn a
program into a maintainer's nightmare.

### Range Values

#### guideline

- Use `'First` or `'Last` instead of numeric literals to represent the
  first or last values of a range.
- Use `'Range` or the subtype name of the range instead of `'First .. 'Last`.

#### example

    type Temperature      is range All_Time_Low .. All_Time_High;
    type Weather_Stations is range            1 ..  Max_Stations;
    Current_Temperature : Temperature := 60;
    Offset              : Temperature;
    ...
    for I in Weather_Stations loop
       Offset := Current_Temperature - Temperature'First;
       ...
    end loop;

#### rationale

In the example above, it is better to use `Weather_Stations` in the
`for` loop than to use `Weather_Stations'First` `.. Weather_Stations'Last` or `1 .. Max_Stations` because it is clearer,
less error-prone, and less dependent on the definition of the type
`Weather_Stations`. Similarly, it is better to use `Temperature'First`
in the offset calculation than to use `All_Time_Low` because the code
will still be correct if the definition of the subtype `Temperature` is
changed. This enhances program reliability.

#### caution

When you implicitly specify ranges and attributes like this, be careful
that you use the correct subtype name. It is easy to refer to a very
large range without realizing it. For example, given the declarations:

    type    Large_Range is new Integer;
    subtype Small_Range is Large_Range range 1 .. 10;

    type Large_Array is array (Large_Range) of Integer;
    type Small_Array is array (Small_Range) of Integer;

then the first declaration below works fine, but the second one is
probably an accident and raises an exception on most machines because it
is requesting a huge array (indexed from the smallest integer to the
largest one):

    Array_1 : Small_Array;
    Array_2 : Large_Array;

### Array Attributes

#### guideline

- Use array attributes `'First`, `'Last`, or `'Length` instead of
  numeric literals for accessing arrays.
- Use the `'Range` of the array instead of the name of the index
  subtype to express a range.
- Use `'Range` instead of `'First .. 'Last` to express a range.

#### example

    subtype Name_String is String (1 .. Name_Length);
    File_Path : Name_String := (others => ' ');
    ...
    for I in File_Path'Range loop
       ...
    end loop;

#### rationale

In the example above, it is better to use `Name_String'Range` in the
`for` loop than to use `Name_String_Size`, `Name_String'First .. Name_String'Last`, or `1 .. 30` because it is clearer, less error-prone,
and less dependent on the definitions of `Name_String` and
`Name_String_Size`. If `Name_String` is changed to have a different
index type or if the bounds of the array are changed, this will still
work correctly. This enhances program reliability.

### Parenthetical Expressions

#### guideline

- Use parentheses to specify the order of subexpression evaluation to
  clarify expressions (NASA 1987 ).
- Use parentheses to specify the order of evaluation for
  subexpressions whose correctness depends on left to right
  evaluation.

#### example

    (1.5 * X**2)/A - (6.5*X + 47.0)
    2*I + 4*Y + 8*Z + C

#### rationale

The Ada rules of operator precedence are defined in the Ada Reference
Manual (1995, ยง4.5) and follow the same commonly accepted precedence of
algebraic operators. The strong typing facility in Ada combined with the
common precedence rules make many parentheses unnecessary. However, when
an uncommon combination of operators occurs, it may be helpful to add
parentheses even when the precedence rules apply. The expression:

    5 + ((Y ** 3) mod 10)

is clearer, and equivalent to:

    5 + Y**3 mod 10

The rules of evaluation do specify left to right evaluation for
operators with the same precedence level. However, it is the most
commonly overlooked rule of evaluation when checking expressions for
correctness.

### Positive Forms of Logic

#### guideline

- Avoid names and constructs that rely on the use of negatives.
- Choose names of flags so they represent states that can be used in
  positive form.

#### example

Use:

    if Operator_Missing then

rather than either:

    if not Operator_Found then

or:

    if not Operator_Missing then

#### rationale

Relational expressions can be more readable and understandable when
stated in a positive form. As an aid in choosing the name, consider that
the most frequently used branch in a conditional construct should be
encountered first.

#### exceptions

There are cases in which the negative form is unavoidable. If the
relational expression better reflects what is going on in the code, then
inverting the test to adhere to this guideline is not recommended.

### Short Circuit Forms of the Logical Operators

#### guideline

- Use short-circuit forms of the logical operators to specify the
  order of conditions when the failure of one condition means that the
  other condition will raise an exception.

#### example

Use:

    if Y /= 0 or else (X/Y) /= 10 then

or:

    if Y /= 0 then
       if (X/Y) /= 10 then

rather than either:

    if Y /= 0 and (X/Y) /= 10 then

or:

    if (X/Y) /= 10 then

to avoid `Constraint_Error.`

Use:

    if Target /= null and then Target.Distance < Threshold then

rather than:

    if Target.Distance < Threshold then

to avoid referencing a field in a nonexistent object.

#### rationale

The use of short-circuit control forms prevents a class of
data-dependent errors or exceptions that can occur as a result of
expression evaluation. The short-circuit forms guarantee an order of
evaluation and an `exit` from the sequence of relational expressions as
soon as the expression's result can be determined.

In the absence of short-circuit forms, Ada does not provide a guarantee
of the order of expression evaluation, nor does the language guarantee
that evaluation of a relational expression is abandoned when it becomes
clear that it evaluates to `False` (for `and`) or `True` (for `or`).

#### notes

If it is important that all parts of a given expression always be
evaluated, the expression probably violates Guideline 4.1.4 , which
limits side-effects in functions.

### Accuracy of Operations With Real Operands

#### guideline

- Use `<=` and `>=` in relational expressions with real operands
  instead of `=`.

#### example

    Current_Temperature   : Temperature :=       0.0;
    Temperature_Increment : Temperature := 1.0 / 3.0;
    Maximum_Temperature   : constant    :=     100.0;
    ...
    loop
       ...
       Current_Temperature :=
             Current_Temperature + Temperature_Increment;
       ...
       exit when Current_Temperature >= Maximum_Temperature;
       ...
    end loop;

#### rationale

Fixed- and floating-point values, even if derived from similar
expressions, may not be exactly equal. The imprecise, finite
representations of real numbers in hardware always have round-off errors
so that any variation in the construction path or history of two real
numbers has the potential for resulting in different numbers, even when
the paths or histories are mathematically equivalent.

The Ada definition of model intervals also means that the use of `<=` is
more portable than either `<` or `=`.

#### notes

Floating-point arithmetic is treated in Guideline 7.2.7 .

#### exceptions

If your application must test for an exact value of a real number (e.g.,
testing the precision of the arithmetic on a certain machine), then the
`=` would have to be used. But never use `=` on real operands as a
condition to exit a loop .
