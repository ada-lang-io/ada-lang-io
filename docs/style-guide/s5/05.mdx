title: 5.5 Expressions
---

Properly coded expressions can enhance the readability and
understandability of a program. Poorly coded expressions can turn a
program into a maintainer's nightmare.

### Range Values

#### guideline

- Use `'First` or `'Last` instead of numeric literals to represent the
  first or last values of a range.
- Use `'Range` or the subtype name of the range instead of
  `'First .. 'Last`.

#### example

```ada
type Temperature      is range All_Time_Low .. All_Time_High;
type Weather_Stations is range            1 ..  Max_Stations;
Current_Temperature : Temperature := 60;
Offset              : Temperature;
...
for I in Weather_Stations loop
   Offset := Current_Temperature - Temperature'First;
   ...
end loop;
```

#### rationale

In the example above, it is better to use `Weather_Stations` in the
`for` loop than to use `Weather_Stations'First .. Weather_Stations'Last`
or `1 .. Max_Stations` because it is clearer, less error-prone, and less
dependent on the definition of the type `Weather_Stations`. Similarly,
it is better to use `Temperature'First` in the offset calculation than
to use `All_Time_Low` because the code will still be correct if the
definition of the subtype `Temperature` is changed. This enhances
program reliability.

#### caution

When you implicitly specify ranges and attributes like this, be careful
that you use the correct subtype name. It is easy to refer to a very
large range without realizing it. For example, given the declarations:

```ada
type    Large_Range is new Integer;
subtype Small_Range is Large_Range range 1 .. 10;

type Large_Array is array (Large_Range) of Integer;
type Small_Array is array (Small_Range) of Integer;
```

then the first declaration below works fine, but the second one is
probably an accident and raises an exception on most machines because it
is requesting a huge array (indexed from the smallest integer to the
largest one):

```ada
Array_1 : Small_Array;
Array_2 : Large_Array;
```

### Array Attributes

#### guideline

- Use array attributes `'First`, `'Last`, or `'Length` instead of
  numeric literals for accessing arrays.
- Use the `'Range` of the array instead of the name of the index subtype
  to express a range.
- Use `'Range` instead of `'First .. 'Last` to express a range.

#### example

```ada
subtype Name_String is String (1 .. Name_Length);
File_Path : Name_String := (others => ' ');
...
for I in File_Path'Range loop
   ...
end loop;
```

#### rationale

In the example above, it is better to use `Name_String'Range` in the
`for` loop than to use `Name_String_Size`,
`Name_String'First .. Name_String'Last`, or `1 .. 30` because it is
clearer, less error-prone, and less dependent on the definitions of
`Name_String` and `Name_String_Size`. If `Name_String` is changed to
have a different index type or if the bounds of the array are changed,
this will still work correctly. This enhances program reliability.

### Parenthetical Expressions

#### guideline

- Use parentheses to specify the order of subexpression evaluation to
  clarify expressions (NASA 1987 ).
- Use parentheses to specify the order of evaluation for subexpressions
  whose correctness depends on left to right evaluation.

#### example

```ada
(1.5 * X**2)/A - (6.5*X + 47.0)
2*I + 4*Y + 8*Z + C
```

#### rationale

The Ada rules of operator precedence are defined in the [Ada Reference
Manual, §4.5](../../arm/AA-4/AA-4.5.mdx) and follow the same commonly
accepted precedence of algebraic operators. The strong typing facility
in Ada combined with the common precedence rules make many parentheses
unnecessary. However, when an uncommon combination of operators occurs,
it may be helpful to add parentheses even when the precedence rules
apply. The expression:

```ada
5 + ((Y ** 3) mod 10)
```

is clearer, and equivalent to:

```ada
5 + Y**3 mod 10
```

The rules of evaluation do specify left to right evaluation for
operators with the same precedence level. However, it is the most
commonly overlooked rule of evaluation when checking expressions for
correctness.

### Positive Forms of Logic

#### guideline

- Avoid names and constructs that rely on the use of negatives.
- Choose names of flags so they represent states that can be used in
  positive form.

#### example

Use:

```ada
if Operator_Missing then
```

rather than either:

```ada
if not Operator_Found then
```

or:

```ada
if not Operator_Missing then
```

#### rationale

Relational expressions can be more readable and understandable when
stated in a positive form. As an aid in choosing the name, consider that
the most frequently used branch in a conditional construct should be
encountered first.

#### exceptions

There are cases in which the negative form is unavoidable. If the
relational expression better reflects what is going on in the code, then
inverting the test to adhere to this guideline is not recommended.

### Short Circuit Forms of the Logical Operators

#### guideline

- Use short-circuit forms of the logical operators to specify the order
  of conditions when the failure of one condition means that the other
  condition will raise an exception.

#### example

Use:

```ada
if Y /= 0 or else (X/Y) /= 10 then
```

or:

```ada
if Y /= 0 then
   if (X/Y) /= 10 then
```

rather than either:

```ada
if Y /= 0 and (X/Y) /= 10 then
```

or:

```ada
if (X/Y) /= 10 then
```

to avoid `Constraint_Error.`

Use:

```ada
if Target /= null and then Target.Distance < Threshold then
```

rather than:

```ada
if Target.Distance < Threshold then
```

to avoid referencing a field in a nonexistent object.

#### rationale

The use of short-circuit control forms prevents a class of
data-dependent errors or exceptions that can occur as a result of
expression evaluation. The short-circuit forms guarantee an order of
evaluation and an `exit` from the sequence of relational expressions as
soon as the expression's result can be determined.

In the absence of short-circuit forms, Ada does not provide a guarantee
of the order of expression evaluation, nor does the language guarantee
that evaluation of a relational expression is abandoned when it becomes
clear that it evaluates to `False` (for `and`) or `True` (for `or`).

#### notes

If it is important that all parts of a given expression always be
evaluated, the expression probably violates Guideline 4.1.4 , which
limits side-effects in functions.

### Accuracy of Operations With Real Operands

#### guideline

- Use `<=` and `>=` in relational expressions with real operands instead
  of `=`.

#### example

```ada
Current_Temperature   : Temperature :=       0.0;
Temperature_Increment : Temperature := 1.0 / 3.0;
Maximum_Temperature   : constant    :=     100.0;
...
loop
   ...
   Current_Temperature :=
         Current_Temperature + Temperature_Increment;
   ...
   exit when Current_Temperature >= Maximum_Temperature;
   ...
end loop;
```

#### rationale

Fixed- and floating-point values, even if derived from similar
expressions, may not be exactly equal. The imprecise, finite
representations of real numbers in hardware always have round-off errors
so that any variation in the construction path or history of two real
numbers has the potential for resulting in different numbers, even when
the paths or histories are mathematically equivalent.

The Ada definition of model intervals also means that the use of `<=` is
more portable than either `<` or `=`.

#### notes

Floating-point arithmetic is treated in Guideline 7.2.7 .

#### exceptions

If your application must test for an exact value of a real number (e.g.,
testing the precision of the arithmetic on a certain machine), then the
`=` would have to be used. But never use `=` on real operands as a
condition to exit a loop .
