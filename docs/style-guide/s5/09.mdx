title: 5.9 Erroneous execution and bounded errors
---

Ada 95 introduces the category of bounded errors. Bounded errors are
cases where the behavior is not deterministic but falls within
well-defined bounds (Rationale 1995, §1.4). The consequence of a bounded
error is to limit the behavior of compilers so that an Ada environment
is not free to do whatever it wants in the presence of errors. The [Ada
Reference Manual (1995)](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-01-01-05.html)
defines a set of possible outcomes for the consequences of undefined
behavior, as in an uninitialized value or a value outside the range of
its subtype. For example, the executing program may raise the predefined
exception `Program_Error`, `Constraint_Error`, or it may do nothing.

An Ada program is _erroneous_ when it generates an error that is not
required to be detected by the compiler or run-time environments. As
stated in the [Ada Reference Manual (1995,
§1.1.5)](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-01-01-05.html), "The effects
of erroneous execution are unpredictable." If the compiler does detect
an instance of an erroneous program, its options are to indicate a
compile time error; to insert the code to raise `Program_Error`,
possibly to write a message to that effect; or to do nothing at all.

Erroneousness is not a concept unique to Ada. The guidelines below
describe or explain some specific instances of erroneousness defined in
the [Ada Reference Manual
(1995)](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-01-01-05.html). These
guidelines are not intended to be all-inclusive but rather emphasize
some commonly overlooked problem areas. Arbitrary order dependencies are
not, strictly speaking, a case of erroneous execution; thus, they are
discussed in Guideline 7.1.9 as a portability issue.

### Unchecked Conversion

#### guideline

- Use `Ada.Unchecked_Conversion` only with the utmost care ([Ada
  Reference Manual 1995,
  §13.9](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-13-09.html)).
- Consider using the `'Valid` attribute to check the validity of
  scalar data.
- Ensure that the value resulting from `Ada.Unchecked_Conversion`
  properly represents a value of the parameter's subtype.
- Isolate the use of `Ada.Unchecked_Conversion` in package bodies.

#### example

The following example shows how to use the `'Valid` attribute to check
validity of scalar data:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Ada.Unchecked_Conversion;
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Integer_Text_IO;

procedure Test is

   type Color is (Red, Yellow, Blue);
   for Color'Size use Integer'Size;

   function Integer_To_Color is
      new Ada.Unchecked_Conversion (Source => Integer,
                                    Target => Color);

   Possible_Color : Color;
   Number         : Integer;

begin  -- Test

   Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Get (Number);
   Possible_Color := Integer_To_Color (Number);

   if Possible_Color'Valid then
      Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(Color'Image(Possible_Color));
   else
      Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Number does not correspond to a color.");
   end if;

end Test;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

An unchecked conversion is a bit-for-bit copy without regard to the
meanings attached to those bits and bit positions by either the source
or the destination type. The source bit pattern can easily be
meaningless in the context of the destination type. Unchecked
conversions can create values that violate type constraints on
subsequent operations. Unchecked conversion of objects mismatched in
size has implementation-dependent results.

Using the `'Valid` attribute on scalar data allows you to check whether
it is in range without raising an exception if it is out of range. There
are several cases where such a validity check enhances the readability
and maintainability of the code:

- - Data produced through an unchecked conversion
  - Input data
  - Parameter values returned from a foreign language interface
  - Aborted assignment (during asynchronous transfer of control or
    execution of an `abort` statement)
  - Disrupted assignment from failure of a language-defined check
  - Data whose address has been specified with the `'Address`
    attribute

An access value should not be assumed to be correct when obtained
without compiler or run-time checks. When dealing with access values,
use of the `'Valid` attribute helps prevent the erroneous dereferencing
that might occur after using `Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation`,
`Unchecked_Access`, or `Ada.Unchecked_Conversion`.

In the case of a nonscalar object used as an actual parameter in an
unchecked conversion, you should ensure that its value on return from
the procedure properly represents a value in the subtype. This case
occurs when the parameter is of mode `out` or `in out`. It is important
to check the value when interfacing to foreign languages or using a
language-defined input procedure. The [Ada Reference Manual (1995,
§13.9.1)](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-13-09-01.html) lists the
full rules concerning data validity.

### Unchecked Deallocation

#### guideline

- Isolate the use of `Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation` in package bodies.
- Ensure that no dangling reference to the local object exists after
  exiting the scope of the local object.

#### rationale

Most of the reasons for using `Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation` with caution
have been given in Guideline 5.4.5. When this feature is used, no
checking is performed to verify that there is only one access path to
the storage being deallocated. Thus, any other access paths are not made
`null`. Depending on the value of these other access paths could result
in erroneous execution.

If your Ada environment implicitly uses dynamic heap storage but does
not fully and reliably reclaim and reuse heap storage, you should not
use `Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation`.

### Unchecked Access

#### guideline

- Minimize the use of the attribute `Unchecked_Access`, preferably
  isolating it to package bodies.
- Use the attribute `Unchecked_Access` only on data whose
  lifetime/scope is "library level."

#### rationale

The accessibility rules are checked statically at compile time (except
for access parameters, which are checked dynamically). These rules
ensure that the access value cannot outlive the object it designates.
Because these rules are not applied in the case of `Unchecked_Access`,
an access path could be followed to an object no longer in scope.

Isolating the use of the attribute `Unchecked_Access` means to isolate
its use from clients of the package. You should not apply it to an
access value merely for the sake of returning a now unsafe value to
clients.

When you use the attribute `Unchecked_Access`, you are creating access
values in an unsafe manner. You run the risk of dangling references,
which in turn lead to erroneous execution ([Ada Reference Manual 1995,
§13.9.1](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-13-09-01.html)).

#### exceptions

The [Ada Reference Manual (1995,
§13.10](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-13-10.html)) defines the
following potential use for this otherwise dangerous attribute. _"This
attribute is provided to support the situation where a local object is
to be inserted into a global linked data structure, when the programmer
knows that it will always be removed from the data structure prior to
exiting the object's scope."_

### Address Clauses

#### guideline

- Use address clauses to map variables and entries to the hardware
  device or memory, not to model the FORTRAN "equivalence" feature.
- Ensure that the address specified in an attribute definition clause
  is valid and does not conflict with the alignment.
- If available in your Ada environment, use the package
  `Ada.Interrupts` to associate handlers with interrupts.
- Avoid using the address clause for nonimported program units.

#### example

```ada
Single_Address : constant System.Address := System.Storage_Elements.To_Address(...);
Interrupt_Vector_Table : Hardware_Array;
for Interrupt_Vector_Table'Address use Single_Address;
```

#### rationale

The result of specifying a single address for multiple objects or
program units is undefined, as is specifying multiple addresses for a
single object or program unit. Specifying multiple address clauses for
an interrupt is also undefined. It does not necessarily overlay objects
or program units, or associate a single entry with more than one
interrupt.

You are responsible for ensuring the validity of an address you specify.
Ada requires that the object of an address be an integral multiple of
its alignment.

In Ada 83 (Ada Reference Manual 1983) you had to use values of type
`System.Address` to attach an interrupt entry to an interrupt. While
this technique is allowed in Ada 95, you are using an obsolete feature.
You should use a protected procedure and the appropriate pragmas
(Rationale 1995, §C.3.2).

### Suppression of Exception Check

#### guideline

- Do not suppress exception checks during development.
- If necessary, during operation, introduce blocks that encompass the
  smallest range of statements that can safely have exception checking
  removed.

#### rationale

If you disable exception checks and program execution results in a
condition in which an exception would otherwise occur, the program
execution is erroneous. The results are unpredictable. Further, you must
still be prepared to deal with the suppressed exceptions if they are
raised in and propagated from the bodies of subprograms, tasks, and
packages you call.

By minimizing the code that has exception checking removed, you increase
the reliability of the program. There is a rule of thumb that suggests
that 20% of the code is responsible for 80% of the CPU time. So, once
you have identified the code that actually needs exception checking
removed, it is wise to isolate it in a block (with appropriate comments)
and leave the surrounding code with exception checking in effect.

### Initialization

#### guideline

- Initialize all objects prior to use.
- Use caution when initializing access values.
- Do not depend on default initialization that is not part of the
  language.
- Derive from a controlled type and override the primitive procedure
  to ensure automatic initialization.
- Ensure elaboration of an entity before using it.
- Use function calls in declarations cautiously.

#### example

The first example illustrates the potential problem with initializing
access values:

```ada
procedure Mix_Letters (Of_String : in out String) is
   type String_Ptr is access String;
   Ptr : String_Ptr := new String'(Of_String);  -- could raise Storage_Error in caller
begin -- Mix_Letters
   ...
exception
   ...  -- cannot trap Storage_Error raised during elaboration of Ptr declaration
end Mix_Letters;
```

The second example illustrates the issue of ensuring the elaboration of
an entity before its use:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
package Robot_Controller is
   ...
   function Sense return Position;
   ...
end Robot_Controller;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
package body Robot_Controller is
...
   Goal : Position := Sense;       -- This raises Program_Error
   ...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   function Sense return Position is
   begin
      ...
   end Sense;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
begin  -- Robot_Controller
   Goal := Sense;                  -- The function has been elaborated.
   ...
end Robot_Controller;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

Ada does not define an initial default value for objects of any type
other than access types, whose initial default value is null. If you are
initializing an access value at the point at which it is declared and
the allocation raises the exception `Storage_Error`, the exception is
raised in the calling not the called procedure. The caller is unprepared
to handle this exception because it knows nothing about the
problem-causing allocation.

Operating systems differ in what they do when they allocate a page in
memory: one operating system may zero out the entire page; a second may
do nothing. Therefore, using the value of an object before it has been
assigned a value causes unpredictable (but bounded) behavior, possibly
raising an exception. Objects can be initialized implicitly by
declaration or explicitly by assignment statements. Initialization at
the point of declaration is safest as well as easiest for maintainers.
You can also specify default values for components of records as part of
the type declarations for those records.

Ensuring initialization does not imply initialization at the
declaration. In the example above, `Goal` must be initialized via a
function call. This cannot occur at the declaration because the function
`Sense` has not yet been elaborated, but it can occur later as part of
the sequence of statements of the body of the enclosing package.

An unelaborated function called within a declaration (initialization)
raises the exception, `Program_Error`, that must be handled outside of
the unit containing the declarations. This is true for any exception the
function raises even if it has been elaborated.

If an exception is raised by a function call in a declaration, it is not
handled in that immediate scope. It is raised to the enclosing scope.
This can be controlled by nesting blocks.

See also Guideline 9.2.3.

#### notes

Sometimes, elaboration order can be dictated with pragma
`Elaborate_All`. Pragma `Elaborate_All` applied to a library unit causes
the elaboration of the transitive closure of the unit and its
dependents. In other words, all bodies of library units reachable from
this library unit's body are elaborated, preventing an
access-before-elaboration error (Rationale 1995, §10.3). Use the pragma
`Elaborate_Body` when you want the body of a package to be elaborated
immediately after its declaration.

**5.9.7 Direct_IO and Sequential_IO**

#### guideline

- Ensure that values obtained from `Ada.Direct_IO` and
  `Ada.Sequential_IO` are in range.
- Use the `'Valid` attribute to check the validity of scalar values
  obtained through `Ada.Direct_IO` and `Ada.Sequential_IO.`

#### rationale

The exception `Data_Error` can be propagated by the `Read` procedures
found in these packages if the element read cannot be interpreted as a
value of the required subtype ([Ada Reference Manual 1995,
§A.13](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-A-13.html)). However, if the
associated check is too complex, an implementation need not propagate
`Data_Error`. In cases where the element read cannot be interpreted as a
value of the required subtype but `Data_Error` is not propagated, the
resulting value can be abnormal, and subsequent references to the value
can lead to erroneous execution.

#### notes

It is sometimes difficult to force an optimizing compiler to perform the
necessary checks on a value that the compiler believes is in range. Most
compiler vendors allow the option of suppressing optimization, which can
be helpful.

### Exception Propagation

#### guideline

Prevent exceptions from propagating outside any user-defined `Finalize`
or `Adjust` procedure by providing handlers for all predefined and
user-defined exceptions at the end of each procedure.

#### rationale

Using `Finalize` or `Adjust` to propagate an exception results in a
bounded error ([Ada Reference Manual 1995,
§7.6.1](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-07-06-01.html)). Either the
exception will be ignored or a `Program_Error` exception will be raised.

### Protected Objects

#### guideline

Do not invoke a potentially blocking operation within a protected entry,
a protected procedure, or a protected function.

#### rationale

The [Ada Reference Manual (1995,
§9.5.1)](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-09-05-01.html) lists the
potentially blocking operations:

- - `Select`statement
  - `Accept` statement
  - Entry-call statement
  - `Delay` statement
  - `Abort` statement
  - Task creation or activation
  - External call on a protected subprogram (or an external requeue)
    with the same target object as that of the protected action
  - Call on a subprogram whose body contains a potentially blocking
    operation

Invoking any of these potentially blocking operations could lead either
to a bounded error being detected or to a deadlock situation. In the
case of bounded error, the exception `Program_Error` is raised. In
addition, avoid calling routines within a protected entry, procedure, or
function that could directly or indirectly invoke operating system
primitives or similar operations that can cause blocking that is not
visible to the Ada run-time system.

### Abort Statement

#### guideline

- Do not use an asynchronous `select`statement within abort-deferred
  operations.
- Do not create a task that depends on a master that is included
  entirely within the execution of an abort-deferred operation.

#### rationale

An abort-deferred operation is one of the following:

- - Protected entry, protected procedure, or protected function
  - User-defined `Initialize` procedure used as the last step of a
    default initialization of a controlled object
  - User-defined `Finalize` procedure used in finalization of a
    controlled object
  - User-defined `Adjust` procedure used in assignment of a
    controlled object

The [Ada Reference Manual (1995,
§9.8)](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-09-08.html) states that the
practices discouraged in the guidelines result in bounded error. The
exception `Program_Error` is raised if the implementation detects the
error. If the implementation does not detect the error, the operations
proceed as they would outside an abort-deferred operation. An `abort`
statement itself may have no effect.
