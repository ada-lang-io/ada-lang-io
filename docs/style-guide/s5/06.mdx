title: 5.6 Statements
---

Careless or convoluted use of statements can make a program hard to read
and maintain even if its global structure is well organized. You should
strive for simple and consistent use of statements to achieve clarity of
local program structure. Some of the guidelines in this section counsel
use or avoidance of particular statements. As pointed out in the
individual guidelines, rigid adherence to those guidelines would be
excessive, but experience has shown that they generally lead to code
with improved reliability and maintainability.

### Nesting

#### guideline

- Minimize the depth of nested expressions (Nissen and Wallis 1984 ).
- Minimize the depth of nested control structures (Nissen and Wallis
  1984 ).
- Try using simplification heuristics (see the following Notes ).

#### instantiation

- Do not nest expressions or control structures beyond a nesting level
  of five.

#### example

The following section of code:

    if not Condition_1 then
       if Condition_2 then
          Action_A;
       else  -- not Condition_2
          Action_B;
       end if;
    else  -- Condition_1
       Action_C;
    end if;

can be rewritten more clearly and with less nesting as:

    if Condition_1 then
       Action_C;
    elsif Condition_2 then
       Action_A;
    else  -- not (Condition_1 or Condition_2)
       Action_B;
    end if;

#### rationale

Deeply nested structures are confusing, difficult to understand, and
difficult to maintain. The problem lies in the difficulty of determining
what part of a program is contained at any given level. For expressions,
this is important in achieving the correct placement of balanced
grouping symbols and in achieving the desired operator precedence. For
control structures, the question involves what part is controlled.
Specifically, is a given statement at the proper level of nesting, that
is, is it too deeply or too shallowly nested, or is the given statement
associated with the proper choice, for example, for `if` or `case`
statements? Indentation helps, but it is not a panacea. Visually
inspecting alignment of indented code (mainly intermediate levels) is an
uncertain job at best. To minimize the complexity of the code, keep the
maximum number of nesting levels between three and five.

#### notes

Ask yourself the following questions to help you simplify the code:

- Can some part of the expression be put into a constant or variable?
- Does some part of the lower nested control structures represent a
  significant and, perhaps, reusable computation that I can factor
  into a subprogram ?
- Can I convert these nested `if` statements into a `case` statement?
- Am I using `else if` where I could be using `elsif`?
- Can I reorder the conditional expressions controlling this nested
  structure?
- Is there a different design that would be simpler?

#### exceptions

If deep nesting is required frequently, there may be overall design
decisions for the code that should be changed. Some algorithms require
deeply nested loops and segments controlled by conditional branches.
Their continued use can be ascribed to their efficiency, familiarity,
and time-proven utility. When nesting is required, proceed cautiously
and take special care with the choice of identifiers and loop and block
names.

### Slices

#### guideline

- Use slices rather than a loop to copy part of an array.

#### example

    First  : constant Index := Index'First;
    Second : constant Index := Index'Succ(First);
    Third  : constant Index := Index'Succ(Second);
    type Vector is array (Index range <>) of Element;
    subtype Column_Vector is Vector (Index);
    type    Square_Matrix is array  (Index) of Column_Vector;
    subtype Small_Range  is Index range First .. Third;
    subtype Diagonals    is Vector (Small_Range);
    type    Tri_Diagonal is array  (Index) of Diagonals;
    Markov_Probabilities : Square_Matrix;
    Diagonal_Data        : Tri_Diagonal;
    ...
    -- Remove diagonal and off diagonal elements.
    Diagonal_Data(Index'First)(First) := Null_Value;
    Diagonal_Data(Index'First)(Second .. Third) :=
          Markov_Probabilities(Index'First)(First .. Second);
    for I in Second .. Index'Pred(Index'Last) loop
       Diagonal_Data(I) :=
             Markov_Probabilities(I)(Index'Pred(I) .. Index'Succ(I));
    end loop;
    Diagonal_Data(Index'Last)(First .. Second) :=
          Markov_Probabilities(Index'Last)(Index'Pred(Index'Last) .. Index'Last);
    Diagonal_Data(Index'Last)(Third) := Null_Value;

#### rationale

An assignment statement with slices is simpler and clearer than a loop
and helps the reader see the intended action. See also Guideline 10.5.7
regarding possible performance issues of slice assignments versus loops.

### Case Statements

#### guideline

- Minimize the use of an `others` choice in a `case` statement.
- Do not use ranges of enumeration literals in `case` statements.
- Use `case` statements rather than `if/elsif` statements, wherever
  possible.
- Use type extension and dispatching rather than `case` statements if,
  possible.

#### example

    type Color is (Red, Green, Blue, Purple);
    Car_Color : Color := Red;
    ...
    case Car_Color is
       when Red .. Blue => ...
       when Purple      => ...
    end case;  -- Car_Color

Now consider a change in the type:

    type Color is (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple);

This change may have an unnoticed and undesired effect in the `case`
statement. If the choices had been enumerated explicitly, as `when Red | Green | Blue =>` instead of `when` `Red .. Blue =>`, then the `case`
statement would not have compiled. This would have forced the maintainer
to make a conscious decision about what to do in the case of `Yellow`.

In the following example, assume that a menu has been posted, and the
user is expected to enter one of the four choices. Assume that
`User_Choice` is declared as a `Character` and that `Terminal_IO.Get`
handles errors in user input. The less readable alternative with the
`if/elsif` statement is shown after the `case` statement:

    Do_Menu_Choices_1:
       loop
          ...

          case User_Choice is
             when 'A'    => Item := Terminal_IO.Get (&quot;Item to add&quot;);
             when 'D'    => Item := Terminal_IO.Get (&quot;Item to delete&quot;);
             when 'M'    => Item := Terminal_IO.Get (&quot;Item to modify&quot;);
             when 'Q'    => exit Do_Menu_Choices_1;

             when others => -- error has already been signaled to user
                null;
          end case;
       end loop Do_Menu_Choices_1;

    Do_Menu_Choices_2:
       loop
          ...

          if User_Choice = 'A' then
             Item := Terminal_IO.Get (&quot;Item to add&quot;);

          elsif User_Choice = 'D' then
             Item := Terminal_IO.Get (&quot;Item to delete&quot;);

          elsif User_Choice = 'M' then
             Item := Terminal_IO.Get (&quot;Item to modify&quot;);

          elsif User_Choice = 'Q' then
             exit Do_Menu_Choices_2;

          end if;
       end loop Do_Menu_Choices_2;

#### rationale

All possible values for an object should be known and should be assigned
specific actions. Use of an `others` clause may prevent the developer
from carefully considering the actions for each value. A compiler warns
the user about omitted values if an `others` clause is not used.

You may not be able to avoid the use of `others` in a `case` statement
when the subtype of the case expression has many values, for example,
`universal_integer`, `Wide_Character`, or `Character`). If your choice
of values is small compared to the range of the subtype, you should
consider using an `if/elsif` statement. Note that you must supply an
`others` alternative when your `case` expression is of a generic type.

Each possible value should be explicitly enumerated. Ranges can be
dangerous because of the possibility that the range could change and the
`case` statement may not be reexamined. If you have declared a subtype
to correspond to the range of interest, you can consider using this
named subtype.

In many instances, `case` statements enhance the readability of the
code. See Guideline 10.5.3 for a discussion of the performance
considerations. In many implementations, `case` statements may be more
efficient.

Type extension and dispatching ease the maintenance burden when you add
a new variant to a data structure. See also Guidelines 5.4.2 and 5.4.4 .

#### notes

Ranges that are needed in `case` statements can use constrained subtypes
to enhance maintainability. It is easier to maintain because the
declaration of the range can be placed where it is logically part of the
abstraction, not buried in a `case` statement in the executable code:

    subtype Lower_Case is Character range 'a' .. 'z';
    subtype Upper_Case is Character range 'A' .. 'Z';
    subtype Control    is Character range Ada.Characters.Latin_1.NUL ..
                                          Ada.Characters.Latin_1.US;
    subtype Numbers    is Character range '0' .. '9';
    ...
    case Input_Char is
       when Lower_Case => Capitalize(Input_Char);
       when Upper_Case => null;
       when Control    => raise Invalid_Input;
       when Numbers    => null;
       ...
    end case;

#### exceptions

It is acceptable to use ranges for possible values only when the user is
certain that new values will never be inserted among the old ones, as
for example, in the range of ASCII characters: `'a' .. 'z'`.

### Loops

#### guideline

- Use `for` loops, whenever possible.
- Use `while` loops when the number of iterations cannot be calculated
  before entering the loop but a simple continuation condition can be
  applied at the top of the loop.
- Use plain loops with `exit` statements for more complex situations.
- Avoid `exit` statements in `while` and `for` loops.
- Minimize the number of ways to `exit` a loop.

#### example

To iterate over all elements of an array:

```ada
for I in Array_Name'Range loop
   ...
end loop;
```

To iterate over all elements in a linked list:

```ada
Pointer := Head_Of_List;
while Pointer /= null loop
   ...
   Pointer := Pointer.Next;
end loop;
```

Situations requiring a "loop and a half" arise often. For this, use:

```ada
P_And_Q_Processing:
   loop
      P;
      exit P_And_Q_Processing when Condition_Dependent_On_P;
      Q;
   end loop P_And_Q_Processing;
```

rather than:

```ada
P;
while not Condition_Dependent_On_P loop
   Q;
   P;
end loop;
```

#### rationale

A `for` loop is bounded, so it cannot be an "infinite loop." This is
enforced by the Ada language, which requires a finite range in the loop
specification and does not allow the loop counter of a `for`loop to be
modified by a statement executed within the loop. This yields a
certainty of understanding for the reader and the writer not associated
with other forms of loops. A `for` loop is also easier to maintain
because the iteration range can be expressed using attributes of the
data structures upon which the loop operates, as shown in the example
above where the range changes automatically whenever the declaration of
the array is modified. For these reasons, it is best to use the `for`
loop whenever possible, that is, whenever simple expressions can be used
to describe the first and last values of the loop counter.

The `while` loop has become a very familiar construct to most
programmers. At a glance, it indicates the condition under which the
loop continues. Use the `while` loop whenever it is not possible to use
the `for` loop but when there is a simple Boolean expression describing
the conditions under which the loop should continue, as shown in the
example above.

The plain loop statement should be used in more complex situations, even
if it is possible to contrive a solution using a `for` or `while` loop
in conjunction with extra flag variables or `exit` statements. The
criteria in selecting a loop construct are to be as clear and
maintainable as possible. It is a bad idea to use an `exit` statement
from within a `for` or `while` loop because it is misleading to the
reader after having apparently described the complete set of loop
conditions at the top of the loop. A reader who encounters a plain loop
statement expects to see `exit` statements.

There are some familiar looping situations that are best achieved with
the plain loop statement. For example, the semantics of the Pascal
`repeat` `until` loop, where the loop is always executed at least once
before the termination test occurs, are best achieved by a plain loop
with a single `exit` at the end of the loop. Another common situation is
the _"loop and a half" construct, shown in the example above, where a
loop must terminate somewhere within the sequence of statements of the
body. Complicated "loop and a half"_ constructs simulated with `while`
loops often require the introduction of flag variables or duplication of
code before and during the loop, as shown in the example. Such
contortions make the code more complex and less reliable.

Minimize the number of ways to `exit` a loop to make the loop more
understandable to the reader. It should be rare that you need more than
two exit paths from a loop. When you do, be sure to use `exit`
statements for all of them, rather than adding an `exit` statement to a
`for` or `while` loop.

### Exit Statements

#### guideline

- Use `exit` statements to enhance the readability of loop termination
  code (NASA 1987).
- Use `exit when ...` rather than`if ... then exit`whenever possible
  (NASA 1987).
- Review `exit` statement placement.

#### example

See the examples in Guidelines 5.1.1 and Guidelines 5.6.4.

#### rationale

It is more readable to use `exit` statements than to try to add Boolean
flags to a `while` loop condition to simulate exits from the middle of a
loop. Even if all `exit` statements would be clustered at the top of the
loop body, the separation of a complex condition into multiple `exit`
statements can simplify and make it more readable and clear. The
sequential execution of two `exit` statements is often more clear than
the short-circuit control forms.

The `exit when` form is preferable to the `if ... then exit` form
because it makes the word `exit` more visible by not nesting it inside
of any control construct. The `if ... then exit` form is needed only in
the case where other statements, in addition to the `exit` statement,
must be executed conditionally. For example:

```ada
Process_Requests:
   loop
      if Status = Done then

         Shut_Down;
         exit Process_Requests;

      end if;

      ...

   end loop Process_Requests;
```

Loops with many scattered `exit` statements can indicate fuzzy thinking
regarding the loop's purpose in the algorithm. Such an algorithm might
be coded better some other way, for example, with a series of loops.
Some rework can often reduce the number of `exit` statements and make
the code clearer.

See also Guidelines 5.1.3 and 5.6.4.

### Recursion and Iteration Bounds

#### guideline

- Consider specifying bounds on loops .
- Consider specifying bounds on recursion .

#### example

Establishing an iteration bound:

```ada
Safety_Counter := 0;
Process_List:
   loop
      exit when Current_Item = null;
      ...
      Current_Item := Current_Item.Next;
      ...
      Safety_Counter := Safety_Counter + 1;
      if Safety_Counter > 1_000_000 then
         raise Safety_Error;
      end if;
   end loop Process_List;
```

Establishing a recursion bound:

```ada
subtype Recursion_Bound is Natural range 0 .. 1_000;

procedure Depth_First (Root           : in     Tree;
                       Safety_Counter : in     Recursion_Bound
                                      := Recursion_Bound'Last) is
begin
   if Root /= null then
      if Safety_Counter = 0 then
         raise Recursion_Error;
      end if;
      Depth_First (Root           => Root.Left_Branch,
                   Safety_Counter => Safety_Counter - 1);

      Depth_First (Root           => Root.Right_Branch,
                   Safety_Counter => Safety_Counter - 1);
      ... -- normal subprogram body
   end if;
end Depth_First;
```

Following are examples of this subprogram's usage. One call specifies a
maximum recursion depth of 50. The second takes the default (1,000). The
third uses a computed bound:

```ada
Depth_First(Root => Tree_1, Safety_Counter => 50);
Depth_First(Tree_2);
Depth_First(Root => Tree_3, Safety_Counter => Current_Tree_Height);
```

#### rationale

Recursion, and iteration using structures other than `for` statements,
can be infinite because the expected terminating condition does not
arise. Such faults are sometimes quite subtle, may occur rarely, and may
be difficult to detect because an external manifestation might be absent
or substantially delayed.

By including counters and checks on the counter values, in addition to
the loops themselves, you can prevent many forms of infinite loops. The
inclusion of such checks is one aspect of the technique called Safe
Programming (Anderson and Witty 1978).

The bounds of these checks do not have to be exact, just realistic. Such
counters and checks are not part of the primary control structure of the
program but a benign addition functioning as an execution-time "safety
net," allowing error detection and possibly recovery from potential
infinite loops or infinite recursion.

#### notes

If a loop uses the `for` iteration scheme (Guideline 5.6.4), it follows
this guideline.

#### exceptions

Embedded control applications have loops that are intended to be
infinite. Only a few loops within such applications should qualify as
exceptions to this guideline. The exceptions should be deliberate (and
documented ) policy decisions.

This guideline is most important to safety critical systems. For other
systems, it may be overkill.

### Goto Statements

#### guideline

Do not use `goto` statements.

#### rationale

A `goto` statement is an unstructured change in the control flow. Worse,
the label does not require an indicator of where the corresponding
`goto` statement(s) are. This makes code unreadable and makes its
correct execution suspect.

Other languages use `goto` statements to implement loop exits and
exception handling. Ada's support of these constructs makes the `goto`
statement extremely rare.

#### notes

If you should ever use a `goto` statement, highlight both it and the
label with blank space. Indicate at the label where the corresponding
`goto` statement(s) may be found.

### Return Statements

#### guideline

- Minimize the number of `return`statementsfrom a subprogram (NASA
  1987).
- Highlight `return`statements with comments or white space to keep
  them from being lost in other code.

#### example

The following code fragment is longer and more complex than necessary:

```ada
if Pointer /= null then
   if Pointer.Count > 0 then
      return True;
   else  -- Pointer.Count = 0
      return False;
   end if;
else  -- Pointer = null
   return False;
end if;
```

It should be replaced with the shorter, more concise, and clearer
equivalent line:

```ada
return Pointer /= null and then Pointer.Count > 0;
```

#### rationale

Excessive use of returns can make code confusing and unreadable. Only
use `return` statements where warranted. Too many returns from a
subprogram may be an indicator of cluttered logic. If the application
requires multiple returns, use them at the same level (i.e., as in
different branches of a `case` statement), rather than scattered
throughout the subprogram code. Some rework can often reduce the number
of `return` statements to one and make the code more clear.

#### exceptions

Do not avoid `return` statements if it detracts from natural structure
and code readability.

### Blocks

#### guideline

- Use blocks to localize the scope of declarations.
- Use blocks to perform local renaming.
- Use blocks to define local exception handlers.

#### example

```ada
with Motion;
with Accelerometer_Device;
...

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   function Maximum_Velocity return Motion.Velocity is

      Cumulative : Motion.Velocity := 0.0;

   begin  -- Maximum_Velocity

      -- Initialize the needed devices
      ...

      Calculate_Velocity_From_Sample_Data:
         declare
            use type Motion.Acceleration;

            Current       : Motion.Acceleration := 0.0;
            Time_Delta    : Duration;

         begin  -- Calculate_Velocity_From_Sample_Data
            for I in 1 .. Accelerometer_Device.Sample_Limit loop

               Get_Samples_And_Ignore_Invalid_Data:
                  begin
                     Accelerometer_Device.Get_Value(Current, Time_Delta);
                  exception
                     when Constraint_Error =>
                        null; -- Continue trying

                     when Accelerometer_Device.Failure =>
                        raise Accelerometer_Device_Failed;
                  end Get_Samples_And_Ignore_Invalid_Data;

               exit when Current <= 0.0; -- Slowing down

               Update_Velocity:
                  declare
                     use type Motion.Velocity;
                     use type Motion.Acceleration;

                  begin
                     Cumulative := Cumulative + Current * Time_Delta;

                  exception
                     when Constraint_Error =>
                        raise Maximum_Velocity_Exceeded;
                  end Update_Velocity;

            end loop;
         end Calculate_Velocity_From_Sample_Data;

      return Cumulative;

   end Maximum_Velocity;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
...
```

#### rationale

Blocks break up large segments of code and isolate details relevant to
each subsection of code. Variables that are only used in a particular
section of code are clearly visible when a declarative block delineates
that code.

Renaming may simplify the expression of algorithms and enhance
readability for a given section of code. But it is confusing when a
`renames` clause is visually separated from the code to which it
applies. The declarative region allows the `renames` to be immediately
visible when the reader is examining code that uses that abbreviation.
Guideline 5.7.1 discusses a similar guideline concerning the `use`
clause.

Local exception handlers can catch exceptions close to the point of
origin and allow them to be either handled, propagated, or converted.

### Aggregates

#### guideline

- Use an aggregate instead of a sequence of assignments to assign
  values to all components of a record.
- Use an aggregate instead of a temporary variable when building a
  record to pass as an actual parameter.
- Use positional association only when there is a conventional
  ordering of the arguments.

#### example

It is better to use aggregates:

```ada
Set_Position((X, Y));
Employee_Record := (Number     => 42,
                    Age        => 51,
                    Department => Software_Engineering);
```

than to use consecutive assignments or temporary variables:

```ada
Temporary_Position.X := 100;
Temporary_Position.Y := 200;
Set_Position(Temporary_Position);
Employee_Record.Number     := 42;
Employee_Record.Age        := 51;
Employee_Record.Department := Software_Engineering;
```

#### rationale

Using aggregates during maintenance is beneficial. If a record structure
is altered, but the corresponding aggregate is not, the compiler flags
the missing field in the aggregate assignment. It would not be able to
detect the fact that a new assignment statement should have been added
to a list of assignment statements.

Aggregates can also be a real convenience in combining data items into a
record or array structure required for passing the information as a
parameter. Named component association makes aggregates more readable.

See Guideline 10.4.5 for the performance impact of aggregates.
