title: 5.1 Optional Parts of the Syntax
---

Parts of the Ada syntax, while optional, can enhance the readability of
the code. The guidelines given below concern use of some of these
optional features.

### Loop Names

#### guideline

- Associate names with loops when they are nested (Booch 1986, 1987).
- Associate names with any loop that contains an `exit`statement.

#### example

```ada
Process_Each_Page:
   loop
      Process_All_The_Lines_On_This_Page:
         loop
            ...
            exit Process_All_The_Lines_On_This_Page when Line_Number = Max_Lines_On_Page;
            ...
            Look_For_Sentinel_Value:
               loop
                  ...
                  exit Look_For_Sentinel_Value when Current_Symbol = Sentinel;
                  ...
               end loop Look_For_Sentinel_Value;
            ...
         end loop Process_All_The_Lines_On_This_Page;
      ...
      exit Process_Each_Page when Page_Number = Maximum_Pages;
      ...
   end loop Process_Each_Page;
```

#### rationale

When you associate a name with a loop, you must include that name with
the associated end for that loop (Ada Reference Manual 1995). This helps
readers find the associated end for any given loop. This is especially
true if loops are broken over screen or page boundaries. The choice of a
good name for the loop documents its purpose, reducing the need for
explanatory comments. If a name for a loop is very difficult to choose,
this could indicate a need for more thought about the algorithm.

Regularly naming loops helps you follow Guideline 5.1.3. Even in the
face of code changes, for example, adding an outer or inner loop, the
`exit` statement does not become ambiguous.

It can be difficult to think up a name for every loop; therefore, the
guideline specifies nested loops. The benefits in readability and second
thought outweigh the inconvenience of naming the loops.

### Block Names

#### guideline

- Associate names with blocks when they are nested.

#### example

```ada
Trip:
   declare
      ...
   begin  -- Trip
      Arrive_At_Airport:
         declare
            ...
         begin  -- Arrive_At_Airport
            Rent_Car;
            Claim_Baggage;
            Reserve_Hotel;
            ...
         end Arrive_At_Airport;
      Visit_Customer:
         declare
            ...
         begin  -- Visit_Customer
            -- again a set of activities...
            ...
         end Visit_Customer;
      Departure_Preparation:
         declare
            ...
         begin  -- Departure_Preparation
            Return_Car;
            Check_Baggage;
            Wait_For_Flight;
            ...
         end Departure_Preparation;
      Board_Return_Flight;
   end Trip;
```

#### rationale

When there is a nested block structure, it can be difficult to determine
which `end` corresponds to which block. Naming blocks alleviates this
confusion. The choice of a good name for the block documents its
purpose, reducing the need for explanatory comments. If a name for the
block is very difficult to choose, this could indicate a need for more
thought about the algorithm.

This guideline is also useful if nested blocks are broken over a screen
or page boundary.

It can be difficult to think up a name for each block; therefore, the
guideline specifies nested blocks. The benefits in readability and
second thought outweigh the inconvenience of naming the blocks.

### Exit Statements

#### guideline

- Use loop names on all `exit` statements from nested loops.

#### example

See the example in 5.1.1 .

#### rationale

An `exit`statement is an implicit `goto`. It should specify its source
explicitly. When there is a nested loop structure and an `exit`statement
is used, it can be difficult to determine which loop is being exited.
Also, future changes that may introduce a nested loop are likely to
introduce an error, with the `exit` accidentally exiting from the wrong
loop. Naming loops and their exits alleviates this confusion. This
guideline is also useful if nested loops are broken over a screen or
page boundary.

### Naming End Statements

#### guideline

- Include the defining program unit name at the end of a package
  specification and body.
- Include the defining identifier at the end of a task specification
  and body.
- Include the entry identifier at the end of an `accept`statement.
- Include the designator at the end of a subprogram body.
- Include the defining identifier at the end of a protected unit
  declaration.

#### example

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
package Autopilot is
   function Is_Engaged return Boolean;
   procedure Engage;
   procedure Disengage;
end Autopilot;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
package body Autopilot is
   ...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   task Course_Monitor is
      entry Reset (Engage : in     Boolean);
   end Course_Monitor;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   function Is_Engaged return Boolean is
   ...
   end Is_Engaged;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   procedure Engage is
   ...
   end Engage;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   procedure Disengage is
   ...
   end Disengage;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   task body Course_Monitor is
   ...
         accept Reset (Engage : in     Boolean) do
            ...
         end Reset;
   ...
   end Course_Monitor;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
end Autopilot;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

Repeating names on the end of these compound statements ensures
consistency throughout the code. In addition, the named `end` provides a
reference for the reader if the unit spans a page or screen boundary or
if it contains a nested unit.
