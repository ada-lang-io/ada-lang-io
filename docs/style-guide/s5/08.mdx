title: 5.8 Using exceptions
---

Ada exceptions are a reliability-enhancing language feature designed to
help specify program behavior in the presence of errors or unexpected
events. Exceptions are not intended to provide a general purpose control
construct. Further, liberal use of exceptions should not be considered
sufficient for providing full software fault tolerance (Melliar-Smith
and Randell 1987).

This section addresses the issues of how and when to avoid raising
exceptions, how and where to handle them, and whether to propagate them.
Information on how to use exceptions as part of the interface to a unit
includes what exceptions to declare and raise and under what conditions
to raise them. Other issues are addressed in the guidelines in Sections
4.3 and 7.5.

### Handling Versus Avoiding Exceptions

#### guideline

- When it is easy and efficient to do so, avoid causing exceptions to be
  raised.
- Provide handlers for exceptions that cannot be avoided.
- Use exception handlers to enhance readability by separating fault
  handling from normal execution.
- Do not use exceptions and exception handlers as `goto` statements.
- Do not evaluate the value of an object (or a part of an object) that
  has become abnormal because of the failure of a language-defined
  check.

#### rationale

In many cases, it is possible to detect easily and efficiently that an
operation you are about to perform would raise an exception. In such a
case, it is a good idea to check rather than allowing the exception to
be raised and handling it with an exception handler. For example, check
each pointer for `null` when traversing a linked list of records
connected by pointers. Also, test an integer for 0 before dividing by
it, and call an interrogative function `Stack_Is_Empty` before invoking
the `Pop` procedure of a stack package. Such tests are appropriate when
they can be performed easily and efficiently as a natural part of the
algorithm being implemented.

However, error detection in advance is not always so simple. There are
cases where such a test is too expensive or too unreliable. In such
cases, it is better to attempt the operation within the scope of an
exception handler so that the exception is handled if it is raised. For
example, in the case of a linked list implementation of a list, it is
very inefficient to call a function `Entry_Exists` before each call to
the procedure `Modify_Entry` simply to avoid raising the exception
`Entry_Not_Found`. It takes as much time to search the list to avoid the
exception as it takes to search the list to perform the update.
Similarly, it is much easier to attempt a division by a real number
within the scope of an exception handler to handle numeric overflow than
to test, in advance, whether the dividend is too large or the divisor
too small for the quotient to be representable on the machine.

In concurrent situations, tests done in advance can also be unreliable.
For example, if you want to modify an existing file on a multiuser
system, it is safer to attempt to do so within the scope of an exception
handler than to test in advance whether the file exists, whether it is
protected, whether there is room in the file system for the file to be
enlarged, etc. Even if you tested for all possible error conditions,
there is no guarantee that nothing would change after the test and
before the modification operation. You still need the exception
handlers, so the advance testing serves no purpose.

Whenever such a case does not apply, normal and predictable events
should be handled by the code without the abnormal transfer of control
represented by an exception. When fault handling and only fault handling
code is included in exception handlers, the separation makes the code
easier to read. The reader can skip all the exception handlers and still
understand the normal flow of control of the code. For this reason,
exceptions should never be raised and handled within the same unit, as a
form of a `goto` statement to exit from a `loop`, `if`, `case`, or
`block` statement.

Evaluating an abnormal object results in erroneous execution ([Ada
Reference Manual, §13.9.1](../../arm/AA-13/AA-13.9.mdx#Subclause_13.9.1)).
The failure of a language-defined check raises an exception. In the
corresponding exception handler, you want to perform appropriate cleanup
actions, including logging the error (see the discussion on exception
occurrences in Guideline 5.8.2) and/or reraising the exception.
Evaluating the object that put you into the exception handling code will
lead to erroneous execution, where you do not know whether your
exception handler has executed completely or correctly. See also
Guideline 5.9.1, which discusses abnormal objects in the context of
`Ada.Unchecked_Conversion`.

### Handlers for Others

#### guideline

- When writing an exception handler for `others`, capture and return
  additional information about the exception through the
  `Exception_Name`, `Exception_Message`, or `Exception_Information`
  subprograms declared in the predefined package `Ada.Exceptions`.
- Use `others` only to catch exceptions you cannot enumerate explicitly,
  preferably only to flag a potential abort.
- During development, trap `others`, capture the exception being
  handled, and consider adding an explicit handler for that exception.

#### example

The following simplified example gives the user one chance to enter an
integer in the range 1 to 3. In the event of an error, it provides
information back to the user. For an integer value that is outside the
expected range, the function reports the name of the exception. For any
other error, the function provides more complete traceback information.
The amount of traceback information is implementation dependent.

```ada
with Ada.Exceptions;
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Integer_Text_IO;
function Valid_Choice return Positive is
   subtype Choice_Range is Positive range 1..3;

   Choice : Choice_Range;
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put ("Please enter your choice: 1, 2, or 3: ");
   Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Get (Choice);
   if Choice in Choice_Range then   -- else garbage returned
      return Choice;
   end if;
   when Out_of_Bounds : Constraint_Error =>
      Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Input choice not in range.");
      Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Name (Out_of_Bounds));
      Ada.Text_IO.Skip_Line;
   when The_Error : others =>
      Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Unexpected error.");
      Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Information (The_Error));
      Ada.Text_IO.Skip_Line;
end Valid_Choice;
```

#### rationale

The predefined package `Ada.Exceptions` allows you to log an exception,
including its name and traceback information. When writing a handler for
`others`, you should provide information about the exception to
facilitate debugging. Because you can access information about an
exception occurrence, you can save information suitable for later
analysis in a standard way. By using exception occurrences, you can
identify the particular exception and either log the details or take
corrective action.

Providing a handler for `others` allows you to follow the other
guidelines in this section. It affords a place to catch and convert
truly unexpected exceptions that were not caught by the explicit
handlers. While it may be possible to provide "fire walls" against
unexpected exceptions being propagated without providing handlers in
every block, you can convert the unexpected exceptions as soon as they
arise. The `others` handler cannot discriminate between different
exceptions, and, as a result, any such handler must treat the exception
as a disaster. Even such a disaster can still be converted into a
user-defined exception at that point. Because a handler for `others`
catches any exception not otherwise handled explicitly, one placed in
the frame of a task or of the main subprogram affords the opportunity to
perform final cleanup and to shut down cleanly.

Programming a handler for `others` requires caution. You should name it
in the handler (e.g., `Error : others;`) to discriminate either which
exception was actually raised or precisely where it was raised. In
general, the `others` handler cannot make any assumptions about what can
be or even what needs to be "fixed."

The use of handlers for `others` during development, when exception
occurrences can be expected to be frequent, can hinder debugging unless
you take advantage of the facilities in `Ada.Exceptions`. It is much
more informative to the developer to see a traceback with the actual
exception information as captured by the `Ada.Exceptions` subprograms.
Writing a handler without these subprograms limits the amount of error
information you may see. For example, you may only see the converted
exception in a traceback that does not list the point where the original
exception was raised.

#### notes

It is possible, but not recommended, to use `Exception_Id` to
distinguish between different exceptions in an `others` handler. The
type `Exception_Id` is implementation defined. Manipulating values of
type `Exception_Id` reduces the portability of your program and makes it
harder to understand.

### Propagation

#### guideline

- Handle all exceptions, both user and predefined.
- For every exception that might be raised, provide a handler in
  suitable frames to protect against undesired propagation outside the
  abstraction.

#### rationale

The statement that _"it can never happen"_ is not an acceptable
programming approach. You must assume it can happen and be in control
when it does. You should provide defensive code routines for the "cannot
get here" conditions.

Some existing advice calls for catching and propagating any exception to
the calling unit. This advice can stop a program. You should catch the
exception and propagate it or a substitute only if your handler is at
the wrong abstraction level to effect recovery. Effecting recovery can
be difficult, but the alternative is a program that does not meet its
specification.

Making an explicit request for termination implies that your code is in
control of the situation and has determined that to be the only safe
course of action. Being in control affords opportunities to shut down in
a controlled manner (clean up loose ends, close files, release surfaces
to manual control, sound alarms) and implies that all available
programmed attempts at recovery have been made.

### Localizing the Cause of an Exception

#### guideline

- Do not rely on being able to identify the fault-raising, predefined,
  or implementation-defined exceptions.
- Use the facilities defined in `Ada.Exceptions` to capture as much
  information as possible about an exception.
- Use blocks to associate localized sections of code with their own
  exception handlers.

#### example

See Guideline 5.6.9.

#### rationale

In an exception handler, it is very difficult to determine exactly which
statement and which operation within that statement raised an exception,
particularly the predefined and implementation-defined exceptions. The
predefined and implementation-defined exceptions are candidates for
conversion and propagation to higher abstraction levels for handling
there. User-defined exceptions, being more closely associated with the
application, are better candidates for recovery within handlers.

User-defined exceptions can also be difficult to localize. Associating
handlers with small blocks of code helps to narrow the possibilities,
making it easier to program recovery actions. The placement of handlers
in small blocks within a subprogram or task body also allows resumption
of the subprogram or task after the recovery actions. If you do not
handle exceptions within blocks, the only action available to the
handlers is to shut down the task or subprogram as prescribed in
Guideline 5.8.3.

As discussed in Guideline 5.8.2, you can log run-time system information
about the exception. You can also attach a message to the exception.
During code development, debugging, and maintenance, this information
should be useful to localize the cause of the exception.

#### notes

The optimal size for the sections of code you choose to protect by a
block and its exception handlers is very application-dependent. Too
small a granularity forces you to expend more effort in programming for
abnormal actions than for the normal algorithm. Too large a granularity
reintroduces the problems of determining what went wrong and of resuming
normal flow.
