title: 5.2 Parameter Lists
---

A subprogram or entry parameter list is the interface to the abstraction
implemented by the subprogram or entry. It is important that it is clear
and that it is expressed in a consistent style. Careful decisions about
formal parameter naming and ordering can make the purpose of the
subprogram easier to understand, which can make it easier to use.

### Formal Parameters

#### guideline

- Name formal parameters descriptively to reduce the need for
  comments.

#### example

    List_Manager.Insert (Element     => New_Employee,
                         Into_List   => Probationary_Employees,
                         At_Position => 1);

#### rationale

Following the variable naming guidelines ( 3.2.1 and 3.2.3 ) for formal
parameters can make calls to subprograms read more like regular prose,
as shown in the example above, where no comments are necessary.
Descriptive names of this sort can also make the code in the body of the
subprogram more clear.

### Named Association

#### guideline

- Use named parameter association in calls of infrequently used
  subprograms or entries with many formal parameters.
- Use named association when instantiating generics.
- Use named association for clarification when the actual parameter is
  any literal or expression.
- Use named association when supplying a nondefault value to an
  optional parameter.

#### instantiation

- Use named parameter association in calls of subprograms or entries
  called from less than five places in a single source file or with
  more than two formal parameters.

#### example

    Encode_Telemetry_Packet (Source         => Power_Electronics,
                             Content        => Temperature,
                             Value          => Read_Temperature_Sensor(Power_Electronics),
                             Time           => Current_Time,
                             Sequence       => Next_Packet_ID,
                             Vehicle        => This_Spacecraft,
                             Primary_Module => True);

#### rationale

Calls of infrequently used subprograms or entries with many formal
parameters can be difficult to understand without referring to the
subprogram or entry code. Named parameter association can make these
calls more readable.

When the formal parameters have been named appropriately, it is easier
to determine exactly what purpose the subprogram serves without looking
at its code. This reduces the need for named constants that exist solely
to make calls more readable. It also allows variables used as actual
parameters to be given names indicating what they are without regard to
why they are being passed in a call. An actual parameter, which is an
expression rather than a variable, cannot be named otherwise.

Named association allows subprograms to have new parameters inserted
with minimal ramifications to existing calls.

#### notes

The judgment of when named parameter association improves readability is
subjective. Certainly, simple or familiar subprograms, such as a swap
routine or a sine function, do not require the extra clarification of
named association in the procedure call.

#### caution

A consequence of named parameter association is that the formal
parameter names may not be changed without modifying the text of each
call.

### Default Parameters

#### guideline

- Provide default parameters to allow for occasional, special use of
  widely used subprograms or entries.
- Place default parameters at the end of the formal parameter list.
- Consider providing default values to new parameters added to an
  existing subprogram.

#### example

Ada Reference Manual (1995) contains many examples of this practice.

#### rationale

Often, the majority of uses of a subprogram or entry need the same value
for a given parameter. Providing that value, as the default for the
parameter, makes the parameter optional on the majority of calls. It
also allows the remaining calls to customize the subprogram or entry by
providing different values for that parameter.

Placing default parameters at the end of the formal parameter list
allows the caller to use positional association on the call; otherwise,
defaults are available only when named association is used.

Often during maintenance activities, you increase the functionality of a
subprogram or entry. This requires more parameters than the original
form for some calls. New parameters may be required to control this new
functionality. Give the new parameters default values that specify the
old functionality. Calls needing the old functionality need not be
changed; they take the defaults. This is true if the new parameters are
added to the end of the parameter list, or if named association is used
on all calls. New calls needing the new functionality can specify that
by providing other values for the new parameters.

This enhances maintainability in that the places that use the modified
routines do not themselves have to be modified, while the previous
functionality levels of the routines are allowed to be _"reused."_

#### exceptions

Do not go overboard. If the changes in functionality are truly radical,
you should be preparing a separate routine rather than modifying an
existing one. One indicator of this situation would be that it is
difficult to determine value combinations for the defaults that uniquely
and naturally require the more restrictive of the two functions. In such
cases, it is better to go ahead with creation of a separate routine.

### Mode Indication

#### guideline

- Show the mode indication of all procedure and entry parameters
  (Nissen and Wallis 1984 ).
- Use the most restrictive parameter mode applicable to your
  application.

#### example

    procedure Open_File (File_Name   : in     String;
                         Open_Status :    out Status_Codes);
    entry Acquire (Key      : in     Capability;
                   Resource :    out Tape_Drive);

#### rationale

By showing the mode of parameters, you aid the reader. If you do not
specify a parameter mode, the default mode is `in`. Explicitly showing
the mode indication of all parameters is a more assertive action than
simply taking the default mode. Anyone reviewing the code later will be
more confident that you intended the parameter mode to be `in`.

Use the mode that reflects the actual use of the parameter. You should
avoid the tendency to make all parameters `in out` mode because `out`
mode parameters may be examined as well as updated.

#### exceptions

It may be necessary to consider several alternative implementations for
a given abstraction. For example, a bounded stack can be implemented as
a pointer to an array. Even though an update to the object being pointed
to does not require changing the pointer value itself, you may want to
consider making the mode `in out` to allow changes to the implementation
and to document more accurately what the operation is doing. If you
later change the implementation to a simple array, the mode will have to
be `in out`, potentially causing changes to all places that the routine
is called.
