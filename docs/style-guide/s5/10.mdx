title: 5.10 Summary
---

#### optional parts of the syntax

- Associate names with loops when they are nested (Booch 1986, 1987).
- Associate names with any loop that contains an `exit`statement.
- Associate names with blocks when they are nested .
- Use loop names on all `exit`statements from nested loops.
- Include the defining program unit name at the end of a package
  specification and body.
- Include the defining identifier at the end of a task specification
  and body.
- Include the entry identifier at the end of an `accept` statement.
- Include the designator at the end of a subprogram body.
- Include the defining identifier at the end of a protected unit
  declaration.

#### parameter lists

- Name formal parametername formal parameters descriptively to reduce
  the need for comments .
- Use named parameter association in calls of infrequently used
  subprograms or entries with many formal parameters .
- Use named association when instantiating generics.
- Use named association for clarification when the actual parameter is
  any literal or expression.
- Use named association when supplying a nondefault value to an
  optional parameter.
- Provide default parameters to allow for occasional, special use of
  widely used subprograms or entries.
- Place default parameters at the end of the formal parameter list.
- Consider providing default values to new parameters added to an
  existing subprogram.
- Show the mode indication of all procedure and entry parameters
  (Nissen and Wallis 1984).
- Use the most restrictive parameter mode applicable to your
  application.

#### types

- Use existing types as building blocks by deriving new types from
  them.
- Use range constraints on subtypes.
- Define new types, especially derived types, to include the largest
  set of possible values, including boundary values.
- Constrain the ranges of derived types with subtypes, excluding
  boundary values.
- Use type derivation rather than type extension when there are no
  meaningful components to add to the type.
- Avoid anonymous array types.
- Use anonymous array types for array variables only when no suitable
  type exists or can be created and the array will not be referenced
  as a whole (e.g., used as a subprogram parameter).
- Use access parameters and access discriminants to guarantee that the
  parameter or discriminant is treated as a constant.
- Derive from controlled types in preference to using limited private
  types.
- Use limited private types in preference to private types.
- Use private types in preference to nonprivate types.
- Explicitly export needed operations rather than easing restrictions.
- Use access-to-subprogram types for indirect access to subprograms.
- Wherever possible, use abstract tagged types and dispatching rather
  than access-to-subprogram types to implement dynamic selection and
  invocation of subprograms.

#### data structures

- When declaring a discriminant, use as constrained a subtype as
  possible (i.e., subtype with as specific a range constraint as
  possible).
- Use a discriminated record rather than a constrained array to
  represent an array whose actual values are unconstrained.
- Use records to group heterogeneous but related data.
- Consider records to map to I/O device data.
- Use access types to class-wide types to implement heterogeneous
  polymorphic data structures.
- Use tagged types and type extension rather than variant records (in
  combination with enumeration types and case statements).
- Record structures should not always be flat. Factor out common
  parts.
- For a large record structure, group related components into smaller
  subrecords.
- For nested records, pick element names that read well when inner
  elements are referenced.
- Consider using type extension to organize large data structures.
- Differentiate between static and dynamic data. Use dynamically
  allocated objects with caution.
- Use dynamically allocated data structures only when it is necessary
  to create and destroy them dynamically or to be able to reference
  them by different names.
- Do not drop pointers to undeallocated objects.
- Do not leave dangling references to deallocated objects.
- Initialize all access variables and components within a record.
- Do not rely on memory deallocation.
- Deallocate explicitly.
- Use length clauses to specify total allocation size.
- Provide handlers for `Storage_Error`.
- Use controlled types to implement private types that manipulate
  dynamic data.
- Avoid unconstrained record objects unless your run-time environment
  reliably reclaims dynamic heap storage.
- Unless your run-time environment reliably reclaims dynamic heap
  storage, declare the following items only in the outermost, unnested
  declarative part of either a library package, a main subprogram, or
  a permanent task:
  - Access types
  - Constrained composite objects with nonstatic bounds
  - Objects of an unconstrained composite type other than
    unconstrainedrecords
  - Composite objects large enough (at compile time) for the
    compiler to allocate implicitly on the heap
- Unless your run-time environment reliably reclaims dynamic heap
  storage or you are creating permanent, dynamically allocated tasks,
  avoid declaring tasks in the following situations:
  - Unconstrained array subtypes whose components are tasks
  - Discriminated record subtypes containing a component that is an
    array of tasks, where the array size depends on the value of the
    discriminant
  - Any declarative region other than the outermost, unnested
    declarative part of either a library package or a main
    subprogram
  - Arrays of tasks that are not statically constrained
- Minimize the use of aliased variables.
- Use aliasing for statically created, ragged arrays (Rationale 1995,
  ยง3.7.1).
- Use aliasing to refer to part of a data structure when you want to
  hide the internal connections and bookkeeping information.
- Use access discriminants to create self-referential data structures,
  i.e., a data structure one of whose components points to the
  enclosing structure.
- Use modular types rather than a Boolean arrays when you create data
  structures that need bit-wise operations, such as `and` and `or`.

#### expressions

- Use `'First` or `'Last` instead of numeric literals to represent the
  first or last values of a range.
- Use `'Range` or the subtype name of the range instead of `'First .. 'Last`.
- Use array attributes `'First`, `'Last`, or `'Length` instead of
  numeric literals for accessing arrays.
- Use the `'Range` of the array instead of the name of the index
  subtype to express a range.
- Use `'Range` instead of `'First .. 'Last` to express a range.
- Use parentheses to specify the order of subexpression evaluation to
  clarify expressions (NASA 1987).
- Use parentheses to specify the order of evaluation for
  subexpressions whose correctness depends on left to right
  evaluation.
- Avoid names and constructs that rely on the use of negatives .
- Choose names of flags so they represent states that can be used in
  positive form.
- Use short-circuit forms of the logical operators to specify the
  order of conditions when the failure of one condition means that the
  other condition will raise an exception.
- Use `<=` and `>=` in relational expressions with real operands
  instead of `=`.

#### statements

- Minimize the depth of nested expressions (Nissen and Wallis 1984).
- Minimize the depth of nested control structures (Nissen and Wallis
  1984).
- Try using simplification heuristics.
- Use slices rather than a loop to copy part of an array.
- Minimize the use of an `others` choice in a `case`statement.
- Do not use ranges of enumeration literals in `case` statements.
- Use `case` statements rather than `if/elsif` statements, wherever
  possible.
- Use type extension and dispatching rather than `case` statements, if
  possible.
- Use `for` loops, whenever possible.
- Use `while` loops when the number of iterations cannot be calculated
  before entering the loop but a simple continuation condition can be
  applied at the top of the loop.
- Use plain loops with `exit` statements for more complex situations.
- Avoid `exit` statements in `while` and `for` loops.
- Minimize the number of ways to exit a loop.
- Use `exit` statements to enhance the readability of loop termination
  code (NASA 1987).
- Use `exit when ...` rather than`if ... then exit`whenever possible
  (NASA 1987).
- Review `exit` statement placement.
- Consider specifying bounds on loops.
- Consider specifying bounds on recursion.
- Do not use `goto` statements.
- Minimize the number of `return`statementsfrom a subprogram (NASA
  1987).
- Highlight `return`statements with comments or white space to keep
  them from being lost in other code.
- Use blocks to localize the scope of declarations.
- Use blocks to perform local renaming.
- Use blocks to define local exception handlers.
- Use an aggregate instead of a sequence of assignments to assign
  values to all components of a record
- Use an aggregate instead of a temporary variable when building a
  record to pass as an actual parameter
- Use positional association only when there is a conventional
  ordering of the arguments.

#### visibility

- When you need to provide visibility to operators, use the `use type`
  clause.
- Avoid/minimize the use of the `use` clause (Nissen and Wallis 1984).
- Consider using a package `renames` clause rather than a `use` clause
  for a package.
- Consider using the `use` clause in the following situations:
  - When standard packages are needed and no ambiguous references
    are introduced
  - When references to enumeration literals are needed
- Localize the effect of all `use` clauses.
- Limit the scope of a renaming declaration to the minimum necessary
  scope.
- Rename a long, fully qualified name to reduce the complexity if it
  becomes unwieldy.
- Use renaming to provide the body of a subprogram if this subprogram
  merely calls the first subprogram.
- Rename declarations for visibility purposes rather than using the
  use clause, except for operators .
- Rename parts when your code interfaces to reusable components
  originally written with nondescriptive or inapplicable nomenclature.
- Use a project-wide standard list of abbreviations to rename common
  packages.
- Provide a `use type` rather than a `renames` clause to provide
  visibility to operators.
- Limit overloading to widely used subprograms that perform similar
  actions on arguments of different types (Nissen and Wallis 1984).
- Preserve the conventional meaning of overloaded operators (Nissen
  and Wallis 1984).
- Use "`+`" to identify adding, joining, increasing, and enhancing
  kinds of functions.
- Use "`-`" to identify subtraction, separation, decreasing, and
  depleting kinds of functions.
- Use operator overloading sparingly and uniformly when applied to
  tagged types.
- Define an appropriate equality operator for private types.
- Consider redefining the equality operator for a private type.
- When overloading the equality operator for types, maintain the
  properties of an algebraic equivalence relation.

#### using exceptions

- When it is easy and efficient to do so, avoid causing exceptions to
  be raised.
- Provide handlers for exceptions that cannot be avoided.
- Use exception handlers to enhance readability by separating fault
  handling from normal execution.
- Do not use exceptions and exception handlers as `goto` statements.
- Do not evaluate the value of an object (or a part of an object) that
  has become abnormal because of the failure of a language-defined
  check.
- When writing an exception handler for `others`, capture and return
  additional information about the exception through the
  `Exception_Name`, `Exception_Message`, or `Exception_Information`
  subprograms declared in the predefined package `Ada.Exceptions`.
- Use `others` only to catch exceptions you cannot enumerate
  explicitly, preferably only to flag a potential abort.
- During development, trap `others`, capture the exception being
  handled, and consider adding an explicit handler for that exception.
- Handle all exceptions, both user and predefined .
- For every exception that might be raised, provide a handler in
  suitable frames to protect against undesired propagation outside the
  abstraction .
- Do not rely on being able to identify the fault-raising, predefined,
  or implementation-defined exceptions.
- Use the facilities defined in `Ada.Exceptions` to capture as much
  information as possible about an exception.
- Use blocks to associate localized sections of code with their own
  exception handlers.

#### erroneous execution and bounded errors

- Use `Ada.Unchecked_Conversion` only with the utmost care ([Ada
  Reference Manual 1995,
  ยง13.9](http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-13-09.html)).
- Consider using the `'Valid` attribute to check the validity of
  scalar data).
- Ensure that the value resulting from `Ada.Unchecked_Conversion`
  properly represents a value of the parameter's subtype.
- Isolate the use of `Ada.Unchecked_Conversion` in package bodies.
- Isolate the use of `Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation` in package bodies.
- Ensure that no dangling reference to the local object exists after
  exiting the scope of the local object.
- Minimize the use of the attribute `Unchecked_Access`, preferably
  isolating it to package bodies.
- Use the attribute `Unchecked_Access` only on data whose
  lifetime/scope is "library level."
- Use address clauses to map variables and entries to the hardware
  device or memory, not to model the FORTRAN "equivalence" feature.
- Ensure that the address specified in an attribute definition clause
  is valid and does not conflict with the alignment.
- If available in your Ada environment, use the package
  `Ada.Interrupts` to associate handlers with interrupts.
- Avoid using the address clause for nonimported program units.
- Do not suppress exception checks during development.
- If necessary, during operation, introduce blocks that encompass the
  smallest range of statements that can safely have exception checking
  removed.
- Initialize all objects , including access values, prior to use.
- Use caution when initializing access values.
- Do not depend on default initialization that is not part of the
  language.
- Derive from a controlled type and override the primitive procedure
  to ensure automatic initialization.
- Ensure elaboration of an entity before using it.
- Use function calls in declarations cautiously.
- Ensure that values obtained from `Ada.Direct_IO` and
  `Ada.Sequential_IO` are in range.
- Use the `'Valid` attribute to check the validity of scalar values
  obtained through `Ada.Direct_IO` and `Ada.Sequential_IO.`
- Prevent exceptions from propagating outside any user-defined
  `Finalize` or `Adjust` procedure by providing handlers for all
  predefined and user-defined exceptions at the end of each procedure.
- Do not invoke a potentially blocking operation within a protected
  entry, a protected procedure, or a protected function.
- Do not use an asynchronous select statement within abort-deferred
  operations.
- Do not create a task that depends on a master that is included
  entirely within the execution of an abort-deferred operation.
