title: 4.1 High-Level Structure
---

Well-structured programs are easily understood, enhanced, and
maintained. Poorly structured programs are frequently restructured
during maintenance just to make the job easier. Many of the guidelines
listed below are often given as general program design guidelines.

### Separate Compilation Capabilities

#### guideline

- Place the specification of each library unit package in a separate
  file from its body.
- Avoid defining library unit subprograms that are not intended to be
  used as main programs. If such subprograms are defined, then create
  an explicit specification, in a separate file, for each library unit
  subprogram.
- Minimize the use of subunits.
- In preference to subunits, use child library units to structure a
  subsystem into manageable units.
- Place each subunit in a separate file.
- Use a consistent file naming convention.
- In preference to nesting in a package body, use a private child and
  with it to the parent body.
- Use private child unit specifications for data and subprograms that
  are required by (other) child units that extend a parent unit's
  abstraction or services.

#### example

The file names below illustrate one possible file organization and
associated consistent naming convention. The library unit name uses the
adb suffix for the body. The suffix ads indicates the specification, and
any files containing subunits use names constructed by separating the
body name from the subunit name with an underscore:

`text_io.ads — the specification`  
`text_io.adb — the body`  
`text_io_integer_io.adb — a subunit`  
`text_io_fixed_io.adb — a subunit`  
`text_io_float_io.adb — a subunit`  
`text_io_enumeration_io.adb — a subunit`

Depending on what characters your file system allows you to use in file
names, you could show the distinction between parent and subunit name
more clearly in the file name. If your file system allows the "\#"
character, for example, you could separate the body name from the
subunit name with a \#:

`text_io.ads — the specification`  
`text_io.adb — the body`  
`text_io#integer_io.adb — a subunit`  
`text_io#fixed_io.adb — a subunit`  
`text_io#float_io.adb — a subunit`  
`text_io#enumeration_io.adb — a subunit`

Some operating systems are case-sensitive, although Ada itself is not a
case-sensitive language. For example, you could choose a convention of
all lowercase file names.

#### rationale

The main reason for the emphasis on separate files in this guideline is
to minimize the amount of recompilation required after each change.
Typically, during software development, bodies of units are updated far
more often than specifications. If the body and specification reside in
the same file, then the specification will be compiled each time the
body is compiled, even though the specification has not changed. Because
the specification defines the interface between the unit and all of its
users, this recompilation of the specification typically makes
recompilation of all users necessary in order to verify compliance with
the specification. If the specifications and bodies of the users also
reside together, then any users of these units will also have to be
recompiled and so on. The ripple effect can force a huge number of
compilations that could have been avoided, severely slowing the
development and test phase of a project. This is why you should place
specifications of all library units (nonnested units) in separate files
from their bodies.

Library unit subprograms should be minimized. The only real use for
library unit subprograms is as the main subprogram. In almost all other
cases, it is better to embed the subprogram into a package. This
provides a place (the package body) to localize data needed by the
subprogram. Moreover, it cuts down on the number of separate modules in
the system.

In general, you should use a separate specification for any library
subprogram that is mentioned in a with clause. This makes the with'ing
unit dependent on the library subprogram specification, not its body.

You should minimize the use of subunits because they create maintenance
problems. Declarations appearing in the parent body are visible in the
subunit, increasing the amount of data global to the subunit and, thus,
increasing the potential ripple effect of changes. Subunits hinder reuse
because they provide an incentive to put otherwise reusable code in the
subunit directly rather than in a common routine called from multiple
subprograms.

With the availability of child library units in Ada 95, you can avoid
most uses of subunits. For example, instead of using a subunit for a
large nested body, you should try to encapsulate this code in a child
library unit and add the necessary context clauses. You can modify the
body of the child unit without having to recompile any of the other
units in a subsystem.

An additional benefit of using multiple, separate files is that it
allows different implementors to modify different parts of the system at
the same time with conventional editors, which do not allow multiple
concurrent updates to a single file.

Finally, keeping bodies and specifications separate makes it possible to
have multiple bodies for the same specification or multiple
specifications for the same body. Although Ada requires that there be
exactly one specification per body in a system at any given time, it can
still be useful to maintain multiple bodies or multiple specifications
for use in different builds of a system. For example, a single
specification may have multiple bodies, each of which implements the
same functionality with a different tradeoff of time versus space
efficiency, or, for machine-dependent code, there may be one body for
each target machine. Maintaining multiple package specifications can
also be useful during development and test. You may develop one
specification for delivery to your customer and another for unit
testing. The first one would export only those subprograms intended to
be called from outside of the package during normal operation of the
system. The second one would export all subprograms of the package so
that each of them could be independently tested.

A consistent file naming convention is recommended to make it easier to
manage the large number of files that may result from following this
guideline.

In implementing the abstraction defined in a package specification, you
often need to write supporting subprograms that manipulate the internal
representation of the data. These subprograms should not be exported on
the interface. You have a choice of whether to place them in the package
body of the parent program or in a child package named in a context
clause of the parent package body. When you place them in the parent
package body, you make them inaccessible to all clients of the parent,
including extensions of the parent declared in child packages. If these
subprograms are needed to implement extensions of the parent
abstraction, you would be forced to modify both the parent specification
and the body because you would have to declare the extensions within the
parent specification. This technique would then force recompilation of
the entire package (specification and body) as well as all its clients.

Alternatively, you can implement the supporting subprograms in a private
child package. Because the parent unit's specification is not modified,
neither it nor its clients need to be recompiled. The data and
subprograms that might have declared in the parent unit body must now be
declared in the private child unit's specification to make them visible
to both the parent unit body and to any child units that extend the
parent unit's services or abstractions. (See also Guidelines 4.1.6 and
4.2.) This use of private child units will generally minimize
recompilations within the unit family and among its clients.

In declaring the child package private, you achieve a similar effect to
declaring it in the parent package body to the extent that clients of
the parent cannot name the private child in a context clause. You gain
flexibility because now you can extend the parent abstraction using
child packages without having to recompile the parent specification or
its body, assuming that you do not otherwise modify the parent or its
body. This added flexibility will usually compensate for the increased
dependency between units, in this case, the additional context clause on
the parent body (and other child package bodies) that names the private
child package of supporting subprograms.

### Configuration Pragmas

#### guideline

- When possible, express configuration pragmas through compiler
  options or other means that do not require modifications to the
  source code.
- When configuration pragmas must be placed in source code, consider
  isolating them to one compilation unit per partition; if specified,
  the main subprogram for the partition is recommended.

#### rationale

Configuration pragmas are generally used to select a partition-wide or
system-wide option. Usually, they reflect either high-level software
architecture decisions (e.g., pragma Task_Dispatching_Policy) or the
use of the software in a particular application domain (e.g.,
safety-critical software). If a configuration pragma is embedded within
a software component and that component is reused in a different context
where the pragma is no longer appropriate, then it may cause problems in
the new application. Such problems can include the rejection by the
compilation system of otherwise legal source code or unexpected behavior
at run-time. These problems can be significant given the wide scope of a
configuration pragma. In addition, maintenance of the original system
may require that some of these system-wide decisions be changed. If the
configuration pragmas are scattered throughout the software, it may be
difficult to locate the lines that need to change.

As a result, it is recommended that all configuration pragmas be kept in
a single compilation unit if possible to make them easy to locate and
modify as needed. If this compilation unit is unlikely to be reused
(e.g., a main subprogram), then the likelihood of conflicts with future
reusers is reduced. Finally, if these system-wide decisions are
indicated without embedding them in the code at all, such as through a
compiler option, then the problems described above are even less likely
to occur.

#### exceptions

Certain pragmas (e.g., pragma Suppress) can be used in several forms,
including as a configuration pragma. This guideline does not apply to
such pragmas when they are not used as a configuration pragma.

### Subprograms

#### guideline

- Use subprograms to enhance abstraction.
- Restrict each subprogram to the performance of a single action.

#### example

Your program is required to draw a menu of user options as part of a
menu-driven user interface package. Because the contents of the menu can
vary depending on the user state, the proper way to do this is to write
a subprogram to draw the menu. This way, the output subprogram has one
purpose and the way to determine the menu content is described
elsewhere.

```ada
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
procedure Draw_Menu
      (Title   : in    String;
       Options : in    Menu) is
   ...
begin  -- Draw_Menu
   Ada.Text_IO.New_Page;
   Ada.Text_IO.New_Line;
   Ada.Text_IO.Set_Col (Right_Column);
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Title);
   Ada.Text_IO.New_Line;
   for Choice in Alpha_Numeric loop
     if Options (Choice) /= Empty_Line then
         Valid_Option (Choice) := True;
         Ada.Text_IO.Set_Col (Left_Column);
         Ada.Text_IO.Put (Choice & " -- ");
         Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Options (Choice));
     end if;
     ...
   end loop;
end Draw_Menu;
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

Subprograms are an extremely effective and well-understood abstraction
technique. Subprograms increase program readability by hiding the
details of a particular activity. It is not necessary that a subprogram
be called more than once to justify its existence.

#### notes

Guideline 10.7.1 discusses dealing with the overhead of subroutine
calls.

### Functions

#### guideline

- Use a function when the subprogram's primary purpose is to provide a
  single value.
- Minimize the side effect of a function.
- Consider using a parameterless function when the value does not need
  to be static.
- Use a parameterless function (instead of a constant) if the value
  should be inherited by types derived from the type.
- Use a parameterless function if the value itself is subject to
  change.

#### example

Although reading a character from a file will change what character is
read next, this is accepted as a minor side effect compared to the
primary purpose of the following function:

```ada
function Next_Character return Character is separate;
```

However, the use of a function like this could lead to a subtle problem.
Any time the order of evaluation is undefined, the order of the values
returned by the function will effectively be undefined. In this example,
the order of the characters placed in Word and the order that the
following two characters are given to the Suffix parameters are unknown.
No implementation of the Next_Character function can guarantee which
character will go where:

```ada
   Word : constant String := String'(1 .. 5 => Next_Character);
begin  -- Start_Parsing
   Parse(Keyword => Word,
         Suffix1 => Next_Character,
         Suffix2 => Next_Character);
end Start_Parsing;
```

Of course, if the order is unimportant (as in a random number
generator), then the order of evaluation is unimportant.

The following example shows the use of a parameterless function instead
of a constant:

```ada
type T is private;
function Nil return T;        -- This function is a derivable operation of type T
function Default return T;    -- Also derivable, and the value can be changed by
                              -- recompiling the body of the function
```

This same example could have been written using constants:

```ada
type T is private;
Nil : constant T;
Default : constant T;
```

#### rationale

A side effect is a change to any variable that is not local to the
subprogram. This includes changes to variables by other subprograms and
entries during calls from the function if the changes persist after the
function returns. Side effects are discouraged because they are
difficult to understand and maintain. Additionally, the Ada language
does not define the order in which functions are evaluated when they
occur in expressions or as actual parameters to subprograms. Therefore,
a program that depends on the order in which side effects of functions
occur is erroneous. Avoid using side effects anywhere.

### Packages

#### guideline

- Use packages for information hiding.
- Use packages with tagged types and private types for abstract data
  types.
- Use packages to model abstract entities appropriate to the problem
  domain.
- Use packages to group together related type and object declarations
  (e.g., common declarations for two or more library units).
- Encapsulate machine dependencies in packages. Place a software
  interface to a particular device in a package to facilitate a change
  to a different device.
- Place low-level implementation decisions or interfaces in
  subprograms within packages.
- Use packages and subprograms to encapsulate and hide program details
  that may change (Nissen and Wallis 1984).

#### example

Reading the names and other attributes of external files is highly
machine dependent. A package called Directory could contain type and
subprogram declarations to support a generalized view of an external
directory that contains external files. Its internals may, in turn,
depend on other packages more specific to the hardware or operating
system:

```ada
package Directory is

   type Directory_Listing is limited private;

   procedure Read_Current_Directory (D : in out Directory_Listing);

   generic
      with procedure Process (Filename : in String);
   procedure Iterate (Over : in Directory_Listing);

   ...

private

   type Directory_Listing is ...

end Directory;

---------------------------------------------------------------

package body Directory is

   -- This procedure is machine dependent
   procedure Read_Current_Directory (D : in out Directory_Listing) is separate;

   procedure Iterate (Over : in Directory_Listing) is
      ...
   begin
      ...

      Process (Filename);

      ...
   end Iterate;

   ...

end Directory;
```

#### rationale

Packages are the principal structuring facility in Ada. They are
intended to be used as direct support for abstraction, information
hiding, and modularization. For example, they are useful for
encapsulating machine dependencies as an aid to portability. A single
specification can have multiple bodies isolating implementation-specific
information so other parts of the code do not need to change.

Encapsulating areas of potential change helps to minimize the effort
required to implement that change by preventing unnecessary dependencies
among unrelated parts of the system.

#### notes

The most prevalent objection to this guideline usually involves
performance penalties. See Guideline 10.7.1 for a discussion about
subprogram overhead.

### Child Library Units

#### guideline

- If a new library unit represents a logical extension to the original
  abstraction, define it as a child library unit.
- If a new library unit is independent (e.g., introduces a new
  abstraction that depends only in part on the existing one), then
  encapsulate the new abstraction in a separate library unit.
- Use child packages to implement a subsystem.
- Use public child units for those parts of a subsystem that should be
  visible to clients of the subsystem.
- Use private child units for those parts of a subsystem that should
  not be visible to clients of the subsystem.
- Use private child units for local declarations used only in
  implementing the package specification.
- Use child packages to implement constructors, even when they return
  access values.

#### example

The following example of a windowing system is taken from Cohen et al.
(1993) and illustrates some of the uses of child units in designing
subsystems. The parent (root) package declares the types, subtypes, and
constants that its clients and subsystems need. Individual child
packages provide specific parts of the windowing abstraction, such as
atoms, fonts, graphic output, cursors, and keyboard information:

```ada
package X_Windows is
   ...
private
   ...
end X_Windows;

package X_Windows.Atoms is
   type Atom is private;
   ...
private
   ...
end X_Windows.Atoms;

package X_Windows.Fonts is
   type Font is private;
   ...
private
   ...
end X_Windows.Fonts;

package X_Windows.Graphic_Output is
   type Graphic_Context is private;
   type Image is private;
   ...
private
   ...
end X_Windows.Graphic_Output;

package X_Windows.Cursors is
   ...
end X_Windows.Cursors;

package X_Windows.Keyboard is
   ...
end X_Windows.Keyboard;
```

#### rationale

The user can create more precise packages with less cluttered
interfaces, using child library packages to extend the interfaces as
needed. The parent contains only the relevant functionality. The parent
provides a general-purpose interface, while the child units provide more
complete programming interfaces, tailored to that aspect of an
abstraction that they are extending or defining.

Child packages build on the modular strength of Ada where "the distinct
specification and body decouple the user interface to a package (the
specification) from its implementation (the body)" (Rationale 1995,
§II.7). Child packages provide the added capability of being able to
extend a parent package without recompiling the parent or the parent's
clients.

Child packages allow you to write logically distinct packages that share
a private type. The visibility rules give the private part of the child
specification and the body of the child visibility into the private part
of the parent. Thus, you can avoid creating a monolithic package for the
sake of developing abstractions that share a private type and need to
know its representation. The private representation is not available to
clients of the package, so the abstraction in the package and its
children is maintained.

Using private child packages for local declarations enables you to have
available the support declarations you need when implementing both the
parent package and extensions to the parent package. You enhance the
maintainability of your program by using a common set of support
declarations (data representations, data manipulation subprograms). You
can modify the internal representation and the implementation of the
support subprograms without modifying or recompiling the rest of your
subsystem because these support subprograms are implemented in the body
of the private child package. See also Guidelines 4.1.1, 4.2.1, 8.4.1,
and 8.4.8.

See also Guideline 9.4.1 for a discussion of the use of child library
units in creating a tagged type hierarchy.

### Cohesion

#### guideline

- Make each package serve a single purpose.
- Use packages to group related data, types, and subprograms.
- Avoid collections of unrelated objects and subprograms (NASA 1987;
  Nissen and Wallis 1984).
- Consider restructuring a system to move two highly related units
  into the same package (or package hierarchy) or to move relatively
  independent units into separate packages.

#### example

As a bad example, a package named Project_Definitions is obviously a
"catch all" for a particular project and is likely to be a jumbled mess.
It probably has this form to permit project members to incorporate a
single with clause into their software.

Better examples are packages called Display_Format_Definitions,
containing all the types and constants needed by some specific display
in a specific format, and Cartridge_Tape_Handler, containing all the
types, constants, and subprograms that provide an interface to a
special-purpose device.

#### rationale

The degree to which the entities in a package are related has a direct
impact on the ease of understanding packages and programs made up of
packages. There are different criteria for grouping, and some criteria
are less effective than others. Grouping the class of data or activity
(e.g., initialization modules) or grouping data or activities based on
their timing characteristics is less effective than grouping based on
function or need to communicate through data (Charette 1986).

The "correct" structuring of a system can make a tremendous difference
in the maintainability of a system. Although it may seem painful at the
time, it is important to restructure if the initial structuring is not
quite right.

See also Guideline 5.4.2 on heterogeneous data.

#### notes

Traditional subroutine libraries often group functionally unrelated
subroutines. Even such libraries should be broken into a collection of
packages, each containing a logically cohesive set of subprograms.

### Data Coupling

#### guideline

- Avoid declaring variables in package specifications.

#### example

This is part of a compiler. Both the package handling error messages and
the package containing the code generator need to know the current line
number. Rather than storing this in a shared variable of type Natural,
the information is stored in a package that hides the details of how
such information is represented and makes it available with access
routines:

```ada
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
package Compilation_Status is
   type Line_Number is range 1 .. 2_500_000;
   function Source_Line_Number return Line_Number;
end Compilation_Status;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Compilation_Status;
package Error_Message_Processing is
   -- Handle compile-time diagnostic.
end Error_Message_Processing;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Compilation_Status;

package Code_Generation is
   -- Operations for code generation.
end Code_Generation;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

Strongly coupled program units can be difficult to debug and very
difficult to maintain. By protecting shared data with access functions,
the coupling is lessened. This prevents dependence on the data
structure, and access to the data can be controlled.

#### notes

The most prevalent objection to this guideline usually involves
performance penalties. When a variable is moved to the package body,
subprograms to access the variable must be provided and the overhead
involved during each call to those subprograms is introduced. See
Guideline 10.7.1 for a discussion about subprogram overhead.

### Tasks

#### guideline

- Use tasks to model abstract, asynchronous entities within the
  problem domain.
- Use tasks to define concurrent algorithms for multiprocessor
  architectures.
- Use tasks to perform concurrent, cyclic, or prioritized activities
  (NASA 1987).

#### rationale

The rationale for this guideline is given under Guideline 6.1.2. Chapter
6 discusses tasking in more detail.

### Protected Types

#### guideline

- Use protected types to control or synchronize access to data or
  devices.
- Use protected types to implement synchronization tasks, such as a
  passive resource monitor.

#### example

See example in Guideline 6.1.1.

#### rationale

The rationale for this guideline is given under Guideline 6.1.1. Chapter
6 discusses concurrency and protected types in more detail.
