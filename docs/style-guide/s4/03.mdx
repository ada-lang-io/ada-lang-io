title: 4.3 Exceptions
---

This section addresses the issue of exceptions in the context of program
structures. It discusses how exceptions should be used as part of the
interface to a unit, including what exceptions to declare and raise and
under what conditions to raise them. Information on how to handle,
propagate, and avoid raising exceptions is found in Guideline 5.8.
Guidelines on how to deal with portability issues are in Guideline 7.5.

### Using Exceptions to Help Define an Abstraction

#### guideline

- For unavoidable internal errors for which no user recovery is
  possible, declare a single user-visible exception. Inside the
  abstraction, provide a way to distinguish between the different
  internal errors.
- Do not borrow an exception name from another context.
- Export (declare visibly to the user) the names of all exceptions
  that can be raised.
- In a package, document which exceptions can be raised by each
  subprogram and task entry.
- Do not raise exceptions for internal errors that can be avoided or
  corrected within the unit.
- Do not raise the same exception to report different kinds of errors
  that are distinguishable by the user of the unit.
- Provide interrogative functions that allow the user of a unit to
  avoid causing exceptions to be raised.
- When possible, avoid changing state information in a unit before
  raising an exception.
- Catch and convert or handle all predefined and compiler-defined
  exceptions at the earliest opportunity.
- Do not explicitly raise predefined or implementation-defined
  exceptions.
- Never let an exception propagate beyond its scope.

#### example

This package specification defines two exceptions that enhance the
abstraction:

```ada
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   type Element is private;
package Stack is

   function Stack_Empty return Boolean;
   function Stack_Full  return Boolean;

   procedure Pop  (From_Top :    out Element);
   procedure Push (Onto_Top : in     Element);

   -- Raised when Pop is used on empty stack.
   Underflow : exception;

   -- Raised when Push is used on full stack.
   Overflow  : exception;

end Stack;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
procedure Pop (From_Top :    out Element) is
begin
   ...

   if Stack_Empty then
      raise Underflow;

   else -- Stack contains at least one element
      Top_Index := Top_Index - 1;
      From_Top  := Data(Top_Index + 1);

   end if;
end Pop;
--------------------------------------------------------------------
...
```

#### rationale

Exceptions should be used as part of an abstraction to indicate error
conditions that the abstraction is unable to prevent or correct. Because
the abstraction is unable to correct such an error, it must report the
error to the user. In the case of a usage error (e.g., attempting to
invoke operations in the wrong sequence or attempting to exceed a
boundary condition), the user may be able to correct the error. In the
case of an error beyond the control of the user, the user may be able to
work around the error if there are multiple mechanisms available to
perform the desired operation. In other cases, the user may have to
abandon use of the unit, dropping into a degraded mode of limited
functionality. In any case, the user must be notified.

Exceptions are a good mechanism for reporting such errors because they
provide an alternate flow of control for dealing with errors. This
allows error-handling code to be kept separate from the code for normal
processing. When an exception is raised, the current operation is
aborted and control is transferred directly to the appropriate exception
handler.

Several of the guidelines above exist to maximize the ability of the
user to distinguish and correct different kinds of errors. Declaring new
exception names, rather than raising exceptions declared in other
packages, reduces the coupling between packages and also makes different
exceptions more distinguishable. Exporting the names of all exceptions
that a unit can raise, rather than declaring them internally to the
unit, makes it possible for users of the unit to refer to the names in
exception handlers. Otherwise, the user would be able to handle the
exception only with an others handler. Finally, use comments to document
exactly which of the exceptions declared in a package can be raised by
each subprogram or task entry making it possible for the user to know
which exception handlers are appropriate in each situation.

In situations where there are errors for which the abstraction user can
take no intelligent action (e.g., there is no workaround or degraded
mode), it is better to export a single internal error exception. Within
the package, you should consider distinguishing between the different
internal errors. For instance, you could record or handle different
kinds of internal error in different ways. When you propagate the error
to the user, however, you should use a special internal error exception,
indicating that no user recovery is possible. You should also provide
relevant information when you propagate the error, using the facilities
provided in Ada.Exceptions. Thus, for any abstraction, you effectively
provide N + 1 different exceptions: N different recoverable errors and
one irrecoverable error for which there is no mapping to the
abstraction. Both the application requirements and what the client
needs/wants in terms of error information help you identify the
appropriate exceptions for an abstraction.

Because they cause an immediate transfer of control, exceptions are
useful for reporting unrecoverable errors, which prevent an operation
from being completed, but not for reporting status or modes incidental
to the completion of an operation. They should not be used to report
internal errors that a unit was able to correct invisibly to the user.

To provide the user with maximum flexibility, it is a good idea to
provide interrogative functions that the user can call to determine
whether an exception would be raised if a subprogram or task entry were
invoked. The function Stack_Empty in the above example is such a
function. It indicates whether Underflow would be raised if Pop were
called. Providing such functions makes it possible for the user to avoid
triggering exceptions.

To support error recovery by its user, a unit should try to avoid
changing state during an invocation that raises an exception. If a
requested operation cannot be completely and correctly performed, then
the unit should either detect this before changing any internal state
information or should revert to the state at the time of the request.
For example, after raising the exception Underflow, the stack package in
the above example should remain in exactly the same state it was in when
Pop was called. If it were to partially update its internal data
structures for managing the stack, then future Push and Pop operations
would not perform correctly. This is always desirable, but not always
possible.

User-defined exceptions should be used instead of predefined or
compiler-defined exceptions because they are more descriptive and more
specific to the abstraction. The predefined exceptions are very general
and can be triggered by many different situations. Compiler-defined
exceptions are nonportable and have meanings that are subject to change
even between successive releases of the same compiler. This introduces
too much uncertainty for the creation of useful handlers.

If you are writing an abstraction, remember that the user does not know
about the units you use in your implementation. That is an effect of
information hiding. If any exception is raised within your abstraction,
you must catch it and handle it. The user is not able to provide a
reasonable handler if the original exception is allowed to propagate out
of the body of your abstraction. You can still convert the exception
into a form intelligible to the user if your abstraction cannot
effectively recover on its own.

Converting an exception means raising a user-defined exception in the
handler for the original exception. This introduces a meaningful name
for export to the user of the unit. Once the error situation is couched
in terms of the application, it can be handled in those terms.
