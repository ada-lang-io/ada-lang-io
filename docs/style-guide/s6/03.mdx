title: 6.3 Termination
---

The ability of tasks to interact with each other using Ada's intertask
communication features makes it especially important to manage planned
or unplanned (e.g., in response to a catastrophic exception condition)
termination in a disciplined way. To do otherwise can lead to a
proliferation of undesired and unpredictable side effects as a result of
the termination of a single task. The guidelines on termination focus on
the termination of tasks. Wherever possible, you should use protected
objects (see Guideline 6.1.1), thus avoiding the termination problems
associated with tasks.

### Avoiding Undesired Termination

#### guideline

- Consider using an exception handler for a rendezvous within the main
  loop inside each task.

#### example

In the following example, an exception raised using the primary sensor
is used to change Mode to Degraded still allowing execution of the
system:

```ada
...
loop

   Recognize_Degraded_Mode:
      begin

         case Mode is
            when Primary =>
               select
                  Current_Position_Primary.Request_New_Coordinates (X, Y);
               or
                  delay 0.25;
                  -- Decide whether to switch modes;
               end select;

            when Degraded =>

               Current_Position_Backup.Request_New_Coordinates (X, Y);

         end case;

         ...
      exception
         when Tasking_Error | Program_Error =>
            Mode := Degraded;
      end Recognize_Degraded_Mode;

end loop;
...
```

#### rationale

Allowing a task to terminate might not support the requirements of the
system. Without an exception handler for the rendezvous within the main
task loop, the functions of the task might not be performed.

#### notes

The use of an exception handler is the only way to guarantee recovery
from an entry call to an abnormal task. Use of the 'Terminated attribute
to test a task's availability before making the entry call can introduce
a race condition where the tested task fails after the test but before
the entry call (see Guideline 6.2.3).

### Normal Termination

#### guideline

- Do not create nonterminating tasks unintentionally.
- Explicitly shut down tasks that depend on library packages.
- Confirm that a task is terminated before freeing it with
  Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation.
- Consider using a select statement with a terminate alternative
  rather than an accept statement alone.
- Consider providing a terminate alternative for every selective
  accept that does not require an else part or a delay .
- Do not declare or create a task within a user-defined Finalize
  procedure after the environment task has finished waiting for other
  tasks.

#### example

This task will never terminate:

```ada
---------------------------------------------------------------------
task body Message_Buffer is
   ...
begin  -- Message_Buffer
   loop
      select
         when Head /= Tail => -- Circular buffer not empty
            accept Retrieve (Value :    out Element) do
               ...
            end Retrieve;

      or
         when not ((Head  = Index'First and then
                    Tail  = Index'Last) or else
                   (Head /= Index'First and then
                    Tail  = Index'Pred(Head))    )
                 => -- Circular buffer not full
            accept Store (Value : in     Element);
      end select;
   end loop;
...
end Message_Buffer;
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

The implicit environment task does not terminate until all other tasks
have terminated. The environment task serves as a master for all other
tasks created as part of the execution of the partition; it awaits
termination of all such tasks in order to perform finalization of any
remaining objects of the partition. Thus, a partition will exist until
all library tasks are terminated.

A nonterminating task is a task whose body consists of a nonterminating
loop with no selective accept with terminate or a task that depends on a
library package. Execution of a subprogram or block containing a task
cannot complete until the task terminates. Any task that calls a
subprogram containing a nonterminating task will be delayed
indefinitely.

A task that depends on a library package cannot be forced to terminate
using a selective accept construct with alternative and should be
terminated explicitly during program shutdown. One way to explicitly
shut down tasks that depend on library packages is to provide them with
exit entries and have the main subprogram call the exit entry just
before it terminates.

The Ada Reference Manual (1995, §13.11.2) states that a bounded error
results from freeing a discriminated, unterminated task object. The
danger lies in deallocating the discriminants as a result of freeing the
task object. The effect of unterminated tasks containing bounded errors
at the end of program execution is undefined.

Execution of an accept statement or of a selective accept statement
without an else part, a delay, or a terminate alternative cannot proceed
if no task ever calls the entry(s) associated with that statement. This
could result in deadlock. Following the guideline to provide a terminate
alternative for every selective accept without an else or a delay
entails programming multiple termination points in the task body. A
reader can easily "know where to look" for the normal termination points
in a task body. The termination points are the end of the body's
sequence of statements and alternatives to select statements.

When the environment task has been terminated, either normally or
abnormally, the language does not specify whether to await a task
activated during finalization of the controlled objects in a partition.
While the environment task is waiting for all other tasks in the
partition to complete, starting up a new task during finalization
results in a bounded error (Ada Reference Manual 1995, §10.2). The
exception Program_Error can be raised during creation or activation of
such a task.

#### exceptions

If you are implementing a cyclic executive, you might need a scheduling
task that does not terminate. It has been said that no real-time system
should be programmed to terminate. This is extreme. Systematic shutdown
of many real-time systems is a desirable safety feature.

If you are considering programming a task not to terminate, be certain
that it is not a dependent of a block or subprogram from which the
task's caller(s) will ever expect to return. Because entire programs can
be candidates for reuse (see Chapter 8), note that the task (and
whatever it depends upon) will not terminate. Also be certain that for
any other task that you do wish to terminate, its termination does not
await this task's termination. Reread and fully understand the Ada
Reference Manual (1995, §9.3) on "Task Dependence-Termination of Tasks."

### The Abort Statement

#### guideline

- Avoid using the abort statement.
- Consider using the asynchronous select statement rather than the
  abort statement.
- Minimize uses of the asynchronous select statement.
- Avoid assigning nonatomic global objects from a task or from the
  abortable part of an asynchronous select statement.

#### example

If required in the application, provide a task entry for orderly
shutdown.

The following example of asynchronous transfer of control shows a
database transaction. The database operation may be cancelled (through a
special input key) unless the commit transaction has begun. The code is
extracted from the Rationale (1995, §9.4):

```ada
with Ada.Finalization;
package Txn_Pkg is
   type Txn_Status is (Incomplete, Failed, Succeeded);
   type Transaction is new Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled with private;
   procedure Finalize (Txn : in out transaction);
   procedure Set_Status (Txn    : in out Transaction;
                         Status : in     Txn_Status);
private
   type Transaction is new Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled with
      record
         Status : Txn_Status := Incomplete;
         pragma Atomic (Status);
         . . . -- More components
      end record;
end Txn_Pkg;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
package body Txn_Pkg is
   procedure Finalize (Txn : in out Transaction) is
   begin
      -- Finalization runs with abort and ATC deferred
      if Txn.Status = Succeeded then
         Commit (Txn);
      else
         Rollback (Txn);
      end if;
   end Finalize;
   . . . -- body of procedure Set_Status
end Txn_Pkg;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- sample code block showing how Txn_Pkg could be used:
declare
   Database_Txn : Transaction;
   -- declare a transaction, will commit or abort during finalization
begin
   select  -- wait for a cancel key from the input device
      Input_Device.Wait_For_Cancel;
      -- the Status remains Incomplete, so that the transaction will not commit
   then abort  -- do the transaction
      begin
         Read (Database_Txn, . . .);
         Write (Database_Txn, . . .);
         . . .
         Set_Status (Database_Txn, Succeeded);
         -- set status to ensure the transaction is committed
      exception
         when others =>
            Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Operation failed with unhandled exception:");
            Set_Status (Database_Txn, Failed);
      end;
   end select;
   -- Finalize on Database_Txn will be called here and, based on the recorded
   -- status, will either commit or abort the transaction.
end;
```

#### rationale

When an abort statement is executed, there is no way to know what the
targeted task was doing beforehand. Data for which the target task is
responsible might be left in an inconsistent state. The overall effect
on the system of aborting a task in such an uncontrolled way requires
careful analysis. The system design must ensure that all tasks depending
on the aborted task can detect the termination and respond
appropriately.

Tasks are not aborted until they reach an abort completion point such as
beginning or end of elaboration, a delay statement, an accept statement,
an entry call, a select statement, task allocation, or the execution of
an exception handler. Consequently, the abort statement might not
release processor resources as soon as you might expect. It also might
not stop a runaway task because the task might be executing an infinite
loop containing no abort completion points. There is no guarantee that a
task will not abort until an abort completion point in multiprocessor
systems, but the task will almost always stop running right away.

An asynchronous select statement allows an external event to cause a
task to begin execution at a new point, without having to abort and
restart the task (Rationale 1995, §9.3). Because the triggering
statement and the abortable statement execute in parallel until one of
them completes and forces the other to be abandoned, you need only one
thread of control. The asynchronous select statement improves
maintainability because the abortable statements are clearly delimited
and the transfer cannot be mistakenly redirected.

In task bodies and in the abortable part of an asynchronous select, you
should avoid assigning to nonatomic global objects, primarily because of
the risk of an abort occurring before the nonatomic assignment
completes. If you have one or more abort statements in your application
and the assignment is disrupted, the target object can become abnormal,
and subsequent uses of the object lead to erroneous execution (Ada
Reference Manual 1995, §9.8). In the case of scalar objects, you can use
the attribute 'Valid, but there is no equivalent attribute for nonscalar
objects. (See Guideline 5.9.1 for a discussion of the 'Valid attribute.)
You also can still safely assign to local objects and call operations of
global protected objects.

### Abnormal Termination

#### guideline

- Place an exception handler for others at the end of a task body.
- Consider having each exception handler at the end of a task body
  report the task's demise.
- Do not rely on the task status to determine whether a rendezvous can
  be made with the task.

#### example

This is one of many tasks updating the positions of blips on a radar
screen. When started, it is given part of the name by which its parent
knows it. Should it terminate due to an exception, it signals the fact
in one of its parent's data structures:

```ada
task type Track (My_Index : Track_Index) is
   ...
end Track;
---------------------------------------------------------------------
task body Track is
     Neutral : Boolean := True;
begin  -- Track
   select
      accept ...
      ...
   or
      terminate;
   end select;
   ...
exception
   when others =>
      if not Neutral then
         Station(My_Index).Status := Dead;
      end if;
end Track;
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

A task will terminate if an exception is raised within it for which it
has no handler. In such a case, the exception is not propagated outside
of the task (unless it occurs during a rendezvous). The task simply dies
with no notification to other tasks in the program. Therefore, providing
exception handlers within the task, and especially a handler for others,
ensures that a task can regain control after an exception occurs. If the
task cannot proceed normally after handling an exception, this affords
it the opportunity to shut itself down cleanly and to notify tasks
responsible for error recovery necessitated by the abnormal termination
of the task.

You should not use the task status to determine whether a rendezvous can
be made with the task. If Task A depends on Task B and Task A checks the
status flag before it rendezvouses with Task B, there is a potential
that Task B fails between the status test and the rendezvous. In this
case, Task A must provide an exception handler to handle the
Tasking_Error exception raised by the call to an entry of an abnormal
task (see Guideline 6.3.1).

### Circular Task Calls

#### guideline

- Do not call a task entry that directly or indirectly results in a
  call to an entry of the original calling task.

#### rationale

A software failure known as task deadlock will occur if a task calls one
of its own entries directly or indirectly via a circular chain of calls.

### Setting Exit Status

#### guideline

- Avoid race conditions in setting an exit status code from the main
  program when using the procedure
  Ada.Command_Line.Set_Exit_Status.
- In a program with multiple tasks, encapsulate, serialize, and check
  calls to the procedure Ada.Command_Line.Set_Exit_Status.

#### rationale

In accordance with the rules of Ada, tasks in library-level packages may
terminate after the main program task. If the program permits multiple
tasks to use Set_Exit_Status, then there can be no guarantee that any
particular status value is the one actually returned.
