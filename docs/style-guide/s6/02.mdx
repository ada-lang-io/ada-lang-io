title: 6.2 Communication
---

The need for tasks to communicate gives rise to most of the problems
that make concurrent programming so difficult. Used properly, Ada's
intertask communication features can improve the reliability of
concurrent programs; used thoughtlessly, they can introduce subtle
errors that can be difficult to detect and correct.

### Efficient Task Communication

#### guideline

- Minimize the work performed during a rendezvous.
- Minimize the work performed in the selective accept loop of a task.
- Consider using protected objects for data synchronization and
  communication.

#### example

In the following example, the statements in the accept body are
performed as part of the execution of both the caller task and the task
Server, which contains Operation and Operation2. The statements after
the accept body are executed before Server can accept additional calls
to Operation or Operation2.

```ada
   ...
   loop
      select
         accept Operation do
            -- These statements are executed during rendezvous.
            -- Both caller and server are blocked during this time.
            ...
         end Operation;
         ...
         -- These statements are not executed during rendezvous.
         -- The execution of these statements increases the time required
         --   to get back to the accept and might be a candidate for another task.

      or
         accept Operation_2 do
            -- These statements are executed during rendezvous.
            -- Both caller and server are blocked during this time.
            ...
         end Operation_2;
      end select;
      -- These statements are also not executed during rendezvous,
      -- The execution of these statements increases the time required
      --   to get back to the accept and might be a candidate for another task.

   end loop;
```

#### rationale

To minimize the time required to rendezvous, only work that needs to be
performed during a rendezvous, such as saving or generating parameters,
should be allowed in the accept bodies.

When work is removed from the accept body and placed later in the
selective accept loop, the additional work might still suspend the
caller task. If the caller task calls entry Operation again before the
server task completes its additional work, the caller is delayed until
the server completes the additional work. If the potential delay is
unacceptable and the additional work does not need to be completed
before the next service of the caller task, the additional work can form
the basis of a new task that will not block the caller task.

Operations on protected objects incur less execution overhead than tasks
and are more efficient for data synchronization and communication than
the rendezvous. You must design protected operations to be bounded,
short, and not potentially blocking.

#### notes

In some cases, additional functions can be added to a task. For example,
a task controlling a communication device might be responsible for a
periodic function to ensure that the device is operating correctly. This
type of addition should be done with care, realizing that the response
time of the task might be impacted (see the above rationale).

Minimizing the work performed during a rendezvous or selective accept
loop of a task can increase the rate of execution only when it results
in additional overlaps in processing between the caller and callee or
when other tasks can be scheduled due to the shorter period of
execution. Therefore, the largest increases in execution rates will be
seen in multiprocessor environments. In single-processor environments,
the increased execution rate will not be as significant and there might
even be a small net loss. The guideline is still applicable, however, if
the application could ever be ported to a multiprocessor environment.

### Defensive Task Communication

#### guideline

- Provide a handler for exception Program_Error whenever you cannot
  avoid a selective accept statement whose alternatives can all be
  closed (Honeywell 1986).
- Make systematic use of handlers for Tasking_Error.
- Be prepared to handle exceptions during a rendezvous .
- Consider using a when others exception handler.

#### example

This block allows recovery from exceptions raised while attempting to
communicate a command to another task:

```ada
Accelerate:
   begin
      Throttle.Increase(Step);
   exception
      when Tasking_Error     =>     ...
      when Constraint_Error  =>     ...
      when Throttle_Too_Wide =>     ...
      ...
   end Accelerate;
```

In this select statement, if all the guards happen to be closed, the
program can continue by executing the else part. There is no need for a
handler for Program_Error. Other exceptions can still be raised while
evaluating the guards or attempting to communicate. You will also need
to include an exception handler in the task Throttle so that it can
continue to execute after an exception is raised during the rendezvous:

```ada
...
Guarded:
   begin
      select
         when Condition_1 =>
            accept Entry_1;
      or
         when Condition_2 =>
            accept Entry_2;
      else  -- all alternatives closed
         ...
      end select;
   exception
      when Constraint_Error =>
         ...
   end Guarded;
```

In this select statement, if all the guards happen to be closed,
exception Program_Error will be raised. Other exceptions can still be
raised while evaluating the guards or attempting to communicate:

```ada
Guarded:
   begin
      select
         when Condition_1 =>
            accept Entry_1;
      or
         when Condition_2 =>
            delay Fraction_Of_A_Second;
      end select;
   exception
      when Program_Error     =>  ...
      when Constraint_Error  =>  ...
   end Guarded;
...
```

#### rationale

The exception Program_Error is raised if a selective accept statement
(select statement containing accepts) is reached, all of whose
alternatives are closed (i.e., the guards evaluate to False and there
are no alternatives without guards), unless there is an else part. When
all alternatives are closed, the task can never again progress, so there
is by definition an error in its programming. You must be prepared to
handle this error should it occur.

Because an else part cannot have a guard, it can never be closed off as
an alternative action; thus, its presence prevents Program_Error.
However, an else part, a delay alternative, and a terminate alternative
are all mutually exclusive, so you will not always be able to provide an
else part. In these cases, you must be prepared to handle
Program_Error.

The exception Tasking_Error can be raised in the calling task whenever
it attempts to communicate. There are many situations permitting this.
Few of them are preventable by the calling task.

If an exception is raised during a rendezvous and not handled in the
accept statement, it is propagated to both tasks and must be handled in
two places (see Guideline 5.8). The handling of the others exception can
be used to avoid propagating unexpected exceptions to callers (when this
is the desired effect) and to localize the logic for dealing with
unexpected exceptions in the rendezvous. After handling, an unknown
exception should normally be raised again because the final decision of
how to deal with it might need to be made at the outermost scope of the
task body.

#### notes

There are other ways to prevent Program_Error at a selective accept.
These involve leaving at least one alternative unguarded or proving that
at least one guard will evaluate True under all circumstances. The point
here is that you or your successors will make mistakes in trying to do
this, so you should prepare to handle the inevitable exception.

### Attributes 'Count, 'Callable, and 'Terminated

#### guideline

- Do not depend on the values of the task attributes 'Callable or
  'Terminated ( Nissen and Wallis 1984).
- Do not depend on attributes to avoid Tasking_Error on an entry
  call.
- For tasks, do not depend on the value of the entry attribute 'Count.
- Using the 'Count attribute with protected entries is more reliable
  than using the 'Count attribute with task entries.

#### example

In the following examples, Dispatch'Callable is a Boolean expression,
indicating whether a call can be made to the task Intercept without
raising the exception Tasking_Error. Dispatch'Count indicates the
number of callers currently waiting at entry Transmit.
Dispatch'Terminated is a Boolean expression, indicating whether the task
Dispatch is in a terminated state.

This task is badly programmed because it relies upon the values of the
'Count attributes not changing between evaluating and acting upon them:

```ada
---------------------------------------------------------------------
task body Dispatch is
...
   select
      when Transmit'Count > 0 and Receive'Count = 0 =>
         accept Transmit;
         ...
   or
      accept Receive;
      ...
   end select;
...
end Dispatch;
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

If the following code is preempted between evaluating the condition and
initiating the call, the assumption that the task is still callable
might no longer be valid:

```ada
...
if Dispatch'Callable then
   Dispatch.Receive;
end if;
...
```

#### rationale

Attributes 'Callable, 'Terminated, and 'Count are all subject to race
conditions. Between the time you reference an attribute and the time you
take action, the value of the attribute might change. Attributes
'Callable and 'Terminated convey reliable information once they become
False and True, respectively. If 'Callable is False, you can expect the
callable state to remain constant. If 'Terminated is True, you can
expect the task to remain terminated. Otherwise, 'Terminated and
'Callable can change between the time your code tests them and the time
it responds to the result.

The Ada Reference Manual (1995, ยง9.9) itself warns about the
asynchronous increase and decrease of the value of 'Count. A task can be
removed from an entry queue due to execution of an abort statement as
well as expiration of a timed entry call. The use of this attribute in
guards of a selective accept statement might result in the opening of
alternatives that should not be opened under a changed value of 'Count.

The value of the attribute 'Count is stable for protected units because
any change to an entry queue is itself a protected action, which will
not occur while any other protected action is already proceeding.
Nevertheless, when you use 'Count within an entry barrier of a protected
unit, you should remember that the condition of the barrier is evaluated
both before and after queueing a given caller.

### Unprotected Shared Variables

#### guideline

- Use calls on protected subprograms or entries to pass data between
  tasks rather than unprotected shared variables.
- Do not use unprotected shared variables as a task synchronization
  device.
- Do not reference nonlocal variables in a guard .
- If an unprotected shared variable is necessary, use the pragma
  Volatile or Atomic.

#### example

This code will either print the same line more than once, fail to print
some lines, or print garbled lines (part of one line followed by part of
another) nondeterministically. This is because there is no
synchronization or mutual exclusion between the task that reads a
command and the one that acts on it. Without knowledge about their
relative scheduling, the actual results cannot be predicted:

```ada
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
task body Line_Printer_Driver is
   ...
begin
   loop
      Current_Line := Line_Buffer;
      -- send to device
   end loop;
end Line_Printer_Driver;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
task body Spool_Server is
   ...
begin
   loop
      Disk_Read (Spool_File, Line_Buffer);
   end loop;
end Spool_Server;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The following example shows a vending machine that dispenses the amount
requested into an appropriately sized container. The guards reference
the global variables Num_Requested and Item_Count, leading to a
potential problem in the wrong amount being dispensed into an
inappropriately sized container:

```ada
Num_Requested : Natural;
Item_Count    : Natural := 1000;
task type Request_Manager (Personal_Limit : Natural := 1) is
   entry Make_Request (Num : Natural);
   entry Get_Container;
   entry Dispense;
end Request_Manager;

task body Request_Manager is
begin
   loop
      select
         accept Make_Request (Num : Natural) do
            Num_Requested := Num;
         end Make_Request;
      or
         when Num_Requested < Item_Count =>
            accept Get_Container;
            ...
      or
         when Num_Requested < Item_Count =>
            accept Dispense do
               if Num_Requested <= Personal_Limit then
                  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Please pick up items.");
               else
                  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Sorry! Requesting too many items.");
               end if;
            end Dispense;
      end select;
   end loop;
end Request_Manager;
R1 : Request_Manager (Personal_Limit => 10);
R2 : Request_Manager (Personal_Limit => 2);
```

The interleaving of the execution of R1 and R2 can lead to
Num_Requested being changed before the entry call to Dispense is
accepted. Thus, R1 might receive fewer items than requested or R2's
request might be bounced because the request manager thinks that what R2
is requesting exceeds R2's personal limit. By using the local variable,
you will dispense the correct amount. Furthermore, by using the pragma
Volatile (Ada Reference Manual 1995, ยงC.6), you ensure that the
Item_Count is reevaluated when the guards are evaluated. Given that the
variable Item_Count is not updated in this task body, the compiler
might otherwise have optimized the code and not generated code to
reevaluate Item_Count every time it is read:

```ada
Item_Count : Natural := 1000;
pragma Volatile (Item_Count);
task body Request_Manager is
   Local_Num_Requested : Natural := 0;
begin
   loop
      select
         accept Make_Request (Num : Natural) do
            Local_Num_Requested := Num;
         end Make_Request;
      or
         when Local_Num_Requested <= Personal_Limit =>
            accept Get_Container;
            ...
      or
         when Local_Num_Requested < Item_Count =>
            accept Dispense do
               ... -- output appropriate message if couldn't service request
            end Dispense;
            Item_Count := Item_Count - Local_Num_Requested;
      end select;
   end loop;
end Request_Manager;
```

#### rationale

There are many techniques for protecting and synchronizing data access.
You must program most of them yourself to use them. It is difficult to
write a program that shares unprotected data correctly. If it is not
done correctly, the reliability of the program suffers.

Ada provides protected objects that encapsulate and provide synchronized
access to protected data that is shared between tasks. Protected objects
are expected to provide better performance than the rendezvous that
usually requires introduction of an additional task to manage the shared
data. The use of unprotected shared variables is more error-prone than
the protected objects or rendezvous because the programmer must ensure
that the unprotected shared variables are independently addressable and
that the actions of reading or updating the same unprotected shared
variable are sequential (Ada Reference Manual 1995, ยง9.10; Rationale
1995, ยงII.9).

The first example above has a race condition requiring perfect
interleaving of execution. This code can be made more reliable by
introducing a flag that is set by Spool_Server and reset by
Line_Printer_Driver. An if (condition flag) then delay ... else would
be added to each task loop in order to ensure that the interleaving is
satisfied. However, notice that this approach requires a delay and the
associated rescheduling. Presumably, this rescheduling overhead is what
is being avoided by not using the rendezvous.

You might need to use an object in shared memory to communicate data
between (Rationale 1995, ยงC.5):

- Ada tasks
- An Ada program and concurrent non-Ada processes
- An Ada program and hardware devices

If your environment supports the Systems Programming Annex (Ada
Reference Manual 1995, Annex C), you should indicate whether loads and
stores to the shared object must be indivisible. If you specify the
pragma Atomic, make sure that the object meets the underlying hardware
requirements for size and alignment. Multiple tasks sharing the
predefined random number generator and certain input/output subprograms
can lead to problems with unprotected updates to shared state. The Ada
Reference Manual (1995, ยงA.5.2) points out the need for tasks to
synchronize their access to the random number generators (packages
Ada.Numerics.Float_Random and Ada.Numerics.Discrete_Random). See
Guideline 7.7.5 for the I/O issue.

### Selective Accepts and Entry Calls

#### guideline

- Use caution with conditional entry calls to task entries.
- Use caution with selective accept with else parts.
- Do not depend upon a particular delay in timed entry calls to task
  entries.
- Do not depend upon a particular delay in selective accepts with
  delay alternatives.
- Consider using protected objects instead of the rendezvous for
  data-oriented synchronization.

#### example

The conditional entry call in the following code results in a potential
race condition that might degenerate into a busy waiting loop (i.e.,
perform the same calculation over and over). The task Current_Position
containing entry Request_New_Coordinates might never execute if the
loop-containing task (shown in the following code fragment) has a higher
priority than Current_Position because it does not release the
processing resource:

```ada
task body Calculate_Flightpath is
begin
   ...
   loop

      select
         Current_Position.Request_New_Coordinates (X, Y);
         -- calculate projected location based on new coordinates
         ...

      else
         -- calculate projected location based on last locations
         ...
      end select;

   end loop;
   ...
end Calculate_Flightpath;
```

The addition of a delay, as shown, may allow Current_Position to
execute until it reaches an accept for Request_New_Coordinates:

```ada
task body Calculate_Flightpath is
begin
   ...
   loop

      select
         Current_Position.Request_New_Coordinates(X, Y);
         -- calculate projected location based on new coordinates
         ...

      else
         -- calculate projected location based on last locations
         ...

         delay until Time_To_Execute;
         Time_To_Execute := Time_To_Execute + Period;
      end select;

   end loop;
   ...
end Calculate_Flightpath;
```

The following selective accept with else again does not degenerate into
a busy wait loop only because of the addition of a delay statement:

```ada
task body Buffer_Messages is

   ...

begin

   ...

   loop
      delay until Time_To_Execute;

      select
         accept Get_New_Message (Message : in     String) do
            -- copy message to parameters
            ...
         end Get_New_Message;
      else  -- Don't wait for rendezvous
         -- perform built in test Functions
         ...
      end select;

      Time_To_Execute := Time_To_Execute + Period;
   end loop;

   ...

end Buffer_Messages;
```

The following timed entry call might be considered an unacceptable
implementation if lost communications with the reactor for over 25
milliseconds results in a critical situation:

```ada
task body Monitor_Reactor is
   ...
begin
   ...
   loop

      select
         Reactor.Status(OK);

      or
         delay 0.025;
         -- lost communication for more that 25 milliseconds
         Emergency_Shutdown;
      end select;

      -- process reactor status
      ...
   end loop;
   ...
end Monitor_Reactor;
```

In the following "selective accept with delay" example, the accuracy of
the coordinate calculation function is bounded by time. For example, the
required accuracy cannot be obtained unless Period is within + or -
0.005 seconds. This period cannot be guaranteed because of the
inaccuracy of the delay statement:

```ada
task body Current_Position is
begin
   ...
   loop

      select
         accept Request_New_Coordinates (X :    out Integer;
                                         Y :    out Integer) do
            -- copy coordinates to parameters
            ...
         end Request_New_Coordinates;

      or
         delay until Time_To_Execute;
      end select;

      Time_To_Execute := Time_To_Execute + Period;
      -- Read Sensors
      -- execute coordinate transformations
   end loop;
   ...
end Current_Position;
```

#### rationale

Use of these constructs always poses a risk of race conditions. Using
them in loops, particularly with poorly chosen task priorities , can
have the effect of busy waiting.

These constructs are very much implementation dependent. For conditional
entry calls and selective accepts with else parts, the Ada Reference
Manual (1995, ยง9.7) does not define "immediately." For timed entry calls
and selective accepts with delay alternatives, implementors might have
ideas of time that differ from each other and from your own. Like the
delay statement, the delay alternative on the select construct might
wait longer than the time required (see Guideline 6.1.7).

Protected objects offer an efficient means for providing data-oriented
synchronization. Operations on protected objects incur less execution
overhead than tasks and are more efficient for data synchronization and
communication than the rendezvous. See Guideline 6.1.1 for an example of
this use of protected objects.

### Communication Complexity

#### guideline

- Minimize the number of accept and select statements per task .
- Minimize the number of accept statements per entry.

#### example

Use:

```ada
accept A;
if Mode_1 then
   -- do one thing
else  -- Mode_2
   -- do something different
end if;
```

rather than:

```ada
if Mode_1 then
   accept A;
   -- do one thing
else  -- Mode_2
   accept A;
   -- do something different
end if;
```

#### rationale

This guideline reduces conceptual complexity. Only entries necessary to
understand externally observable task behavior should be introduced. If
there are several different accept and select statements that do not
modify task behavior in a way important to the user of the task, there
is unnecessary complexity introduced by the proliferation of
select/accept statements. Externally observable behavior important to
the task user includes task timing behavior, task rendezvous initiated
by the entry calls, prioritization of entries, or data updates (where
data is shared between tasks).

#### notes

Sanden (1994) argues that you need to trade off the complexity of the
guards associated with the accept statements against the number of
select/accept statements. Sanden (1994) shows an example of a queue
controller for bank tellers where there are two modes, open and closed.
You can implement this scenario with one loop and two select statements,
one for the open mode and the other for the closed mode. Although you
are using more select/accept statements, Sanden (1994) argues that the
resulting program is easier to understand and verify.
