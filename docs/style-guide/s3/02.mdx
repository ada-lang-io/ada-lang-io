title: 3.2 Naming Conventions
---

Choose names that clarify the object's or entity's intended use. Ada
allows identifiers to be any length as long as the identifier fits on a
line with all characters being significant (including underscores).
Identifiers are the names used for variables, constants, program units,
and other entities within a program.

### Names

#### guideline

- Choose names that are as self-documenting as possible.
- Use a short synonym instead of an abbreviation (see Guideline
  3.1.4).
- Use names given by the application, but do not use obscure jargon.
- Avoid using the same name to declare different kinds of identifiers.

#### example

In a tree-walker, using the name `Left` instead of `Left_Branch` is
sufficient to convey the full meaning given the context. However, use
`Time_Of_Day` instead of `TOD`.

Mathematical formulas are often given using single-letter names for
variables. Continue this convention for mathematical equations where
they would recall the formula, for example:

```ada
   A*(X**2) + B*X + C.
```

With the use of child packages, a poor choice of package, subunit, and
identifier names can lead to a visibility clash with subunits. See the
Rationale (1995, §8.1) for a sample of the resulting, rather obscure
code.

#### rationale

A program that follows these guidelines can be more easily comprehended.
Self-documenting names require fewer explanatory comments. Empirical
studies have shown that you can further improve comprehension if your
variable names are not excessively long (Schneiderman 1986, 7). The
context and application can help greatly. The unit of measure for
numeric entities can be a source of subtype names.

You should try not to use the same name as an identifier for different
declarations, such as an object and a child package. Overusing an
identifier in seemingly different name spaces can, in fact, lead to
visibility clashes if the enclosing program units are intended to work
together.

#### notes

See Guideline 8.1.2 for a discussion on how to use the application
domain as a guideline for selecting abbreviations.

### Subtype Names

#### guideline

- Use singular, general nouns as subtype identifiers.
- Choose identifiers that describe one of the subtype's values.
- Consider using suffixes for subtype identifiers that define visible
  access types, visible subranges, or visible array types.
- For private types, do not use identifier constructions (e.g.,
  suffixes) that are unique to subtype identifiers.
- Do not use the subtype names from predefined packages.

#### example

```ada
type Day is
   (Monday,    Tuesday,   Wednesday, Thursday,  Friday,
    Saturday,  Sunday);

type Day_Of_Month    is range      0 ..    31;
type Month_Number    is range      1 ..    12;
type Historical_Year is range -6_000 .. 2_500;

type Date is
   record
      Day   : Day_Of_Month;
      Month : Month_Number;
      Year  : Historical_Year;
   end record;
```

In particular, `Day` should be used in preference to `Days` or
`Day_Type`.

The identifier `Historical_Year` might appear to be specific, but it is
actually general, with the adjective `historical` describing the range
constraint:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
procedure Disk_Driver is

   -- In this procedure, a number of important disk parameters are
   -- linked.
   Number_Of_Sectors  : constant :=     4;
   Number_Of_Tracks   : constant :=   200;
   Number_Of_Surfaces : constant :=    18;
   Sector_Capacity    : constant := 4_096;

   Track_Capacity   : constant := Number_Of_Sectors  * Sector_Capacity;
   Surface_Capacity : constant := Number_Of_Tracks   * Track_Capacity;
   Disk_Capacity    : constant := Number_Of_Surfaces * Surface_Capacity;

   type Sector_Range  is range 1 .. Number_Of_Sectors;
   type Track_Range   is range 1 .. Number_Of_Tracks;
   type Surface_Range is range 1 .. Number_Of_Surfaces;

   type Track_Map   is array (Sector_Range)  of ...;
   type Surface_Map is array (Track_Range)   of Track_Map;
   type Disk_Map    is array (Surface_Range) of Surface_Map;

begin  -- Disk_Driver
   ...
end Disk_Driver;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The suffixes `_Capacity`, `_Range`, and `_Map` help define the purpose
of the above subtypes and avoid the search for synonyms for the sector,
track, and surface abstractions. Without the suffixes, you would need
three different names per abstraction, one to describe each of the
concepts succinctly named in the suffix. This recommendation only
applies to certain visible subtypes. Private types, for example, should
be given a good name that reflects the abstraction being represented.

#### rationale

When this style and the suggested style for object identifiers are used,
program code more closely resembles English (see Guideline 3.2.3).
Furthermore, this style is consistent with the names of the language's
predefined identifiers. They are not named `Integers`, `Booleans`,
`Integer_Type`, or `Boolean_Type`.

However, using the name of a subtype from the predefined packages is
sure to confuse a programmer when that subtype appears somewhere without
a package qualification.

#### notes

This style guide tries to be consistent with the Ada Reference Manual
(1995) in use of the terms "type" and "subtype" name. In general, a
"type" refers to the abstract concept, as in a type declaration, while
the "subtype" refers to the name given to that abstract concept in an
actual declaration. Thus, what was called a type name in Ada 83 (Ada
Reference Manual 1983) is now called a subtype name.

### Object Names

#### guideline

- Use predicate clauses or adjectives for Boolean objects.
- Use singular, specific nouns as object identifiers.
- Choose identifiers that describe the object's value during
  execution.
- Use singular, general nouns as identifiers for record components.

#### example

Non-Boolean objects:

```ada
Today           : Day;
Yesterday       : Day;
Retirement_Date : Date;
```

Boolean objects:

```ada
User_Is_Available : Boolean;        -- predicate clause
List_Is_Empty     : Boolean;        -- predicate clause
Empty             : Boolean;        -- adjective
Bright            : Boolean;        -- adjective
```

#### rationale

Using specific nouns for objects establishes a context for understanding
the object's value, which is one of the general values described by the
subtype's name (see Guideline 3.2.2). Object declarations become very
English-like with this style. For example, the first declaration above
is read as "Today is a Day."

General nouns, rather than specific, are used for record components
because a record object's name will supply the context for understanding
the component. Thus, the following component is understood as "the year
of retirement":

```ada
Retirement_Date.Year
```

Following conventions that relate object types and parts of speech makes
code read more like text. For example, because of the names chosen, the
following code segment needs no comments:

```ada
if List_Is_Empty then
   Number_Of_Elements := 0;
else
   Number_Of_Elements := Length_Of_List;
end if;
```

#### notes

If it is difficult to find a specific noun that describes an object's
value during the entire execution of a program, the object is probably
serving multiple purposes. Multiple objects should be used in such a
case.

### Naming of Tagged Types and Associated Packages

#### guideline

- Use a consistent naming convention for tagged types and associated
  packages.

#### instantiation

Naming conventions spark "religious wars"; therefore, two different
instantiations are presented. The first instantiation integrates the use
of object-oriented features. Except for two special cases, it applies
the same naming conventions to declarations, independent of whether they
use an object-oriented feature:

- Name tagged types no differently than subtype names (see Guideline
  3.2.2).
- Use the prefix `Abstract_` for packages that export an abstraction
  for which you intend to provide multiple implementations (see
  Guideline 9.2.4).
- Use the suffix `_Mixin` for packages that provide units of
  functionality that can be "mixed in" to core abstractions.

The second instantiation highlights the use of object-oriented features
through special names or suffixes:

- Name class packages after the object they represent, without a
  suffix (Rosen 1995).
- Name mixin packages after the facet they represent, appending the
  suffix \_Facet (Rosen 1995).
- Name the main tagged type `Instance` (Rosen 1995).
- Follow the declaration of the specific type with a subtype named
  `Class` for the corresponding class-wide type (Rosen 1995).

#### example

The following two-part example from the Rationale (1995, §§4.4.4 and
4.6.2) applies the naming conventions of the first instantiation.

For the first part of this example, assume the type `Set_Element` was
declared elsewhere:

```ada
package Abstract_Sets is

   type Set is abstract tagged private;

   -- empty set
   function Empty return Set is abstract;

   -- build set with 1 element
   function Unit (Element: Set_Element) return Set is abstract;

   -- union of two sets
   function Union (Left, Right: Set) return Set is abstract;

   -- intersection of two sets
   function Intersection (Left, Right: Set) return Set is abstract;

   -- remove an element from a set
   procedure Take (From    : in out Set;
                   Element :    out set_Element) is abstract;

   Element_Too_Large : exception;
private
   type Set is abstract tagged null record;
end Abstract_Sets;

with Abstract_Sets;
package Bit_Vector_Sets is   -- one implementation of set abstraction

   type Bit_Set is new Abstract_Sets.Set with private;
   ...
private
   Bit_Set_Size : constant := 64;
   type Bit_Vector is ...
   type Bit_Set is new Abstract_Sets.Set with
      record
         Data : Bit_Vector;
      end record;
end Bit_Vector_Sets;

with Abstract_Sets;
package Sparse_Sets  -- alternate implementation of set abstraction

   type Sparse_Set is new Abstract_Sets.Set with private;
   ...
private
   ...
end Bit_Vector_Sets;
```

The second part of this example applies the naming convention to mixin
packages that support a windowing system:

```ada
-- assume you have type Basic_Window is tagged limited private;

generic
   type Some_Window is abstract new Basic_Window with private;
package Label_Mixin is
   type Window_With_Label is abstract new Some_Window with private;
   ...
private
   ...
end Label_Mixin;

generic
   type Some_Window is abstract new Basic_Window with private;
package Border_Mixin is
   type Window_With_Label is abstract new Some_Window with private;
   ...
private
   ...
end Border_Mixin;
```

The following example applies the naming conventions of the second
instantiation, as discussed in Rosen (1995):

```ada
package Shape is
   subtype Side_Count is range 0 .. 100;
   type Instance (Sides: Side_Count) is tagged private;
   subtype Class is Instance'Class;
   . . .
   -- operations on Shape.Instance
private
   . . .
end Shape;

with Shape; use Shape;
package Line is
   type Instance is new Shape.Instance with private;
   subtype Class is Instance'Class;
   . . .
   -- Overridden or new operations
private
   . . .
end Line;

with Shape; use Shape;
generic
   type Origin is new Shape.Instance;
package With_Color_Facet is
   type Instance is new Origin with private;
   subtype Class is Instance'Class;
   -- operations for colored shapes
private
   . . .
end With_Color_Facet;

with Line; use Line;
with With_Color_Facet;
package Colored_Line is new With_Color_Facet (Line.Instance);
```

Sample declarations might look like:

```ada
Red_Line : Colored_Line.Instance;

procedure Draw (What : Shape.Instance);
```

The above scheme works whether you use full names or a `use` clause. As
long as you use the same name for all the specific types (i.e., `type Instance`) and class-wide types, the unqualified names will always hide
one another. Thus, the compiler will insist you use full name
qualification to resolve the ambiguity introduced by the use clause
(Rosen 1995).

#### rationale

You want to use a naming scheme that is consistent and readable and
conveys the intent of the abstraction. Ideally, the naming scheme should
be uniform in how it handles the different ways in which tagged types
are used to create classes. If the naming convention is too rigid,
however, you will write code fragments that appear stilted from a
readability point of view. By using a similar naming convention for type
extension through derivation and through generic mixin (see also
Guideline 9.5.1), you achieve readable declarations of objects and
procedures.

#### notes

A naming convention for classes draws a hard line between
object-oriented abstractions and other kinds of abstractions. Given that
engineers have been defining abstract data types in Ada 83 (Ada
Reference Manual 1983) for over 10 years, you may not want to change the
naming convention just for the sake of using type extension with a type.
You must consider how important it is to call out uses of inheritance in
the overall use of abstractions in your program. If you prefer to
emphasize abstraction, in general, over the mechanism used to implement
the abstraction (i.e., inheritance, type-extension, and polymorphism),
you may not want to impose such a stringent naming convention. You do
not hamper quality by favoring a smoother transition in naming
conventions from abstractions developed without inheritance to those
developed with inheritance.

If you choose a naming convention that highlights the use of
object-oriented features and later decide to change the declaration to
one that does not use an object-oriented feature, the change may be
expensive. You must naturally change all occurrences of the names and
must be careful not to introduce errors as you update the names. If you
choose a naming convention that prohibits the use of suffixes or
prefixes to characterize the declaration, you lose the opportunity to
convey the intended usage of the declared item.

### Program Unit Names

#### guideline

- Use action verbs for procedures and entries.
- Use predicate clauses for Boolean functions.
- Use nouns for non-Boolean functions.
- Give packages names that imply a higher level of organization than
  subprograms. Generally, these are noun phrases that describe the
  abstraction provided.
- Give tasks names that imply an active entity.
- Use nouns descriptive of the data being protected for protected
  units.
- Consider naming generic subprograms as if they were nongeneric
  subprograms.
- Consider naming generic packages as if they were nongeneric
  packages.
- Make the generic names more general than the instantiated names.

#### example

The following are sample names for elements that compose an Ada program:

Sample procedure names:

```ada
procedure Get_Next_Token          -- get is a transitive verb
procedure Create                  -- create is a transitive verb
```

Sample function names for Boolean-valued functions:

```ada
function Is_Last_Item             -- predicate clause
function Is_Empty                 -- predicate clause
```

Sample function names for non-Boolean-valued functions:

```ada
function Successor                -- common noun
function Length                   -- attribute
function Top                      -- component
```

Sample package names:

```ada
package Terminals is               -- common noun
package Text_Routines is           -- common noun
```

Sample protected objects:

```ada
protected Current_Location is      -- data being protected
protected type Guardian is         -- noun implying protection
```

Sample task names:

```ada
task Terminal_Resource_Manager is  -- common noun that shows action
```

The following sample piece of code shows the clarity that results from
using the parts-of-speech naming conventions:

```ada
Get_Next_Token(Current_Token);

case Current_Token is
   when Identifier =>         Process_Identifier;
   when Numeric    =>         Process_Numeric;
end case;  -- Current_Token

if Is_Empty(Current_List) then
   Number_Of_Elements := 0;
else
   Number_Of_Elements := Length(Current_List);
end if;
```

When packages and their subprograms are named together, the resulting
code is very descriptive:

```ada
if Stack.Is_Empty(Current_List) then
   Current_Token := Stack.Top(Current_List);
end if;
```

#### rationale

Using these naming conventions creates understandable code that reads
much like natural language. When verbs are used for actions, such as
subprograms, and nouns are used for objects, such as the data that the
subprogram manipulates, code is easier to read and understand. This
models a medium of communication already familiar to a reader. Where the
pieces of a program model a real-life situation, using these conventions
reduces the number of translation steps involved in reading and
understanding the program. In a sense, your choice of names reflects the
level of abstraction from computer hardware toward application
requirements.

See also Guideline 3.2.4 for the use of special-purpose suffixes in
packages associated with tagged types.

#### notes

There are some conflicting conventions in current use for task entries.
Some programmers and designers advocate naming task entries with the
same conventions used for subprograms to blur the fact that a task is
involved. Their reasoning is that if the task is reimplemented as a
package, or vice versa, the names need not change. Others prefer to make
the fact of a task entry as explicit as possible to ensure that the
existence of a task with its presumed overhead is recognizable.
Project-specific priorities may be useful in choosing between these
conventions.

### Constants and Named Numbers

#### guideline

- Use symbolic values instead of literals where the symbolic value
  improves readability.
- Use symbolic values instead of literals if the value occurs at more
  than one place and might need to be changed.
- Use the predefined constants Ada.Numerics.Pi and Ada.Numerics.e for
  the mathematical constants Pi and e.
- Use constants instead of variables for constant values.
- Use a constant when the value is specific to a type or when the
  value must be static.
- Use named numbers instead of constants, whenever possible.
- Use named numbers to replace numeric literals whose type or context
  is truly universal.
- Use constants for objects whose values cannot change after
  elaboration (United Technologies 1987).
- Show relationships between symbolic values by defining them with
  static expressions.
- Use linearly independent sets of literals.
- Use attributes like 'First and 'Last instead of literals, wherever
  possible.

#### example

```ada
3.14159_26535_89793                                 -- literal
Max_Entries : constant Integer       := 400;        -- constant
Avogadros_Number  : constant := 6.022137 * 10**23;  -- named number
Avogadros_Number / 2                                -- static expression
Avogadros_Number                                    -- symbolic value
```

Declaring `Pi` as a named number (assuming a `with` clause for the
predefined package `Ada.Numerics` in the Ada Reference Manual \[1995,
§A.5\] allows it to be referenced symbolically in the assignment
statement below:

```ada
Area :=       Pi * Radius**2;       -- if radius is known.
```

instead of:

```ada
Area := 3.14159 * Radius**2;        -- Needs explanatory comment
```

Also, `Ada.Characters.Latin_1.Bel` is more expressive than
`Character'Val(8#007#)`.

Clarity of constant and named number declarations can be improved by
using other constant and named numbers. For example:

```ada
Bytes_Per_Page   : constant := 512;
Pages_Per_Buffer : constant := 10;
Buffer_Size      : constant := Pages_Per_Buffer * Bytes_Per_Page;
```

is more self-explanatory and easier to maintain than:

```ada
Buffer_Size : constant := 5_120;   -- ten pages
```

The following literals should be constants:

```ada
if New_Character  = '$' then  -- "constant" that may change
...
if Current_Column = 7 then    -- "constant" that may change
```

#### rationale

Using identifiers instead of literals makes the purpose of expressions
clear, reducing the need for comments. Constant declarations consisting
of expressions of numeric literals are safer because they do not need to
be computed by hand. They are also more enlightening than a single
numeric literal because there is more opportunity for embedding
explanatory names. Clarity of constant declarations can be improved
further by using other related constants in static expressions defining
new constants. This is not less efficient because static expressions of
named numbers are computed at compile time.

A constant has a type. A named number can only be a universal type:
universal_integer or universal_real. Strong typing is enforced for
constants but not for named numbers or literals. Named numbers allow
compilers to generate more efficient code than for constants and to
perform more complete error checking at compile time. If the literal
contains a large number of digits (as Pi in the example above), the use
of an identifier reduces keystroke errors. If keystroke errors occur,
they are easier to locate either by inspection or at compile time.

Independence of literals means that the few literals that are used do
not depend on one another and that any relationship between constant or
named values is shown in the static expressions. Linear independence of
literal values gives the property that if one literal value changes, all
of the named numbers of values dependent on that literal are
automatically changed.

See Guideline 4.1.4 for additional guidelines on choosing a
parameterless function versus a constant.

#### notes

There are situations where a literal is a better choice than a name. For
this to be the case, the following conditions have to be fulfilled:

- The literal has to be self-explanatory in the respective context,
  such that replacing the literal by a symbolic value would not
  improve the readability.
- The value is either unchangeable or only occurs at one single place
  in the code, such that replacing the literal by a symbolic value
  would not improve the maintainability.

For example, the literals in the following well known relationship are
both self-explanatory and unchangeable:

```ada
   Fahrenheit := 32.0 + (9.0 * Celsius) / 5.0;
```

As a second example, dividing by the literal 2 is self-explanatory in a
binary search algorithm context. And, since the value is also
unchangeably related with the algorithm, it also does not matter if the
literal occurs at more than one place in the code (for example due to
loop unrolling). Therefore, the use of a symbolic value like the
following would neither improve readability nor maintainability:

```ada
   Binary_Search_Divisor : constant := 2;
```

### Exceptions

#### guideline

- Use a name that indicates the kind of problem the exception
  represents.

#### example

```ada
Invalid_Name: exception;
Stack_Overflow: exception;
```

#### rationale

Naming exceptions according to the kind of problem they are detecting
enhances the readability of the code. You should name your exceptions as
precisely as you can so that the maintainer of the code understands why
the exception might be raised. A well-named exception should be
meaningful to the clients of the package declaring the exception.

### Constructors

#### guideline

- Include a prefix like `New`, `Make`, or `Create` in naming
  constructors (in this sense, operations to create and/or initialize
  an object).
- Use names indicative of their content for child packages containing
  constructors.

#### instantiation

- Name a child package containing constructors
  `\<whatever\>.Constructor`.

#### example

```ada
function Make_Square (Center : Cartesian_Coordinates;
                      Side   : Positive)
  return Square;
```

#### rationale

Including a word like `New`, `Make`, or `Create` in a constructor name
makes its purpose clear. You may want to restrict the use of the prefix
New to constructors that return an access value because the prefix
suggests the internal use of an allocator.

Putting all constructors in a child package, even when they return
access values, is a useful organizational principle.

For information regarding the use of Ada constructors, refer to
Guideline 9.3.3.
