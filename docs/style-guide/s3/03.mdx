title: 3.3 Comments
---

Comments in source text are a controversial issue. There are arguments
both for and against the view that comments enhance readability. In
practice, the biggest problem with comments is that people often fail to
update them when the associated source text is changed, thereby making
the commentary misleading. Commentary should be reserved for expressing
needed information that cannot be expressed in code and highlighting
cases where there are overriding reasons to violate one of the
guidelines. If possible, source text should use self-explanatory names
for objects and program units, and it should use simple, understandable
program structures so that little additional commentary is needed. The
extra effort in selecting (and entering) appropriate names and the extra
thought needed to design clean and understandable program structures are
fully justified.

Use comments to state the intent of the code. Comments that provide an
overview of the code help the maintenance programmer see the forest for
the trees. The code itself is the detailed "how" and should not be
paraphrased in the comments.

Comments should be minimized. They should provide needed information
that cannot be expressed in the Ada language, emphasize the structure of
code, and draw attention to deliberate and necessary violations of the
guidelines. Comments are present either to draw attention to the real
issue being exemplified or to compensate for incompleteness in the
sample program.

Maintenance programmers need to know the causal interaction of
noncontiguous pieces of code to get a global, more or less complete
sense of the program. They typically acquire this kind of information
from mental simulation of parts of the code. Comments should be
sufficient enough to support this process (Soloway et al. 1986).

This section presents general guidelines about how to write good
comments. It then defines several different classes of comments with
guidelines for the use of each. The classes are file headers, program
unit specification headers, program unit body headers, data comments,
statement comments, and marker comments.

### General Comments

#### guideline

- Make the code as clear as possible to reduce the need for comments.
- Never repeat information in a comment that is readily available in
  the code.
- Where a comment is required, make it concise and complete.
- Use proper grammar and spelling in comments.
- Make comments visually distinct from the code.
- Structure comments in header so that information can be
  automatically extracted by a tool.

#### rationale

The structure and function of well-written code is clear without
comments. Obscured or badly structured code is hard to understand,
maintain, or reuse regardless of comments. Bad code should be improved,
not explained. Reading the code itself is the only way to be absolutely
positive about what the code does; therefore, the code should be made as
readable as possible.

Using comments to duplicate information in the code is a bad idea for
several reasons. First, it is unnecessary work that decreases
productivity. Second, it is very difficult to correctly maintain the
duplication as the code is modified. When changes are made to existing
code, it is compiled and tested to make sure that it is once again
correct. However, there is no automatic mechanism to make sure that the
comments are correctly updated to reflect the changes. Very often, the
duplicate information in a comment becomes obsolete at the first code
change and remains so through the life of the software. Third, when
comments about an entire system are written from the limited point of
view of the author of a single subsystem, the comments are often
incorrect from the start.

Comments are necessary to reveal information difficult or impossible to
obtain from the code. Subsequent chapters of this book contain examples
of such comments. Completely and concisely present the required
information.

The purpose of comments is to help readers understand the code.
Misspelled, ungrammatical, ambiguous, or incomplete comments defeat this
purpose. If a comment is worth adding, it is worth adding correctly in
order to increase its usefulness.

Making comments visually distinct from the code by indenting them,
grouping them together into headers, or highlighting them with dashed
lines is useful because it makes the code easier to read. Subsequent
chapters of this book elaborate on this point.

#### automation notes

The guideline about storing redundant information in comments applies
only to manually generated comments. There are tools that automatically
maintain information about the code (e.g., calling units, called units,
cross-reference information, revision histories, etc.), storing it in
comments in the same file as the code. Other tools read comments but do
not update them, using the information from the comments to
automatically generate detailed design documents and other reports.

The use of such tools is encouraged and may require that you structure
your header comments so they can be automatically extracted and/or
updated. Beware that tools that modify the comments in a file are only
useful if they are executed frequently enough. Automatically generated
obsolete information is even more dangerous than manually generated
obsolete information because it is more trusted by the reader.

Revision histories are maintained much more accurately and completely by
configuration management tools. With no tool support, it is very common
for an engineer to make a change and forget to update the revision
history. If your configuration management tool is capable of maintaining
revision histories as comments in the source file, then take advantage
of that capability, regardless of any compromise you might have to make
about the format or location of the revision history. It is better to
have a complete revision history appended to the end of the file than to
have a partial one formatted nicely and embedded in the file header.

### File Headers

#### guideline

- Put a file header on each source file.
- Place ownership, responsibility, and history information for the
  file in the file header.

#### instantiation

- Put a copyright notice in the file header.
- Put the author's name and department in the file header.
- Put a revision history in the file header, including a summary of
  each change, the date, and the name of the person making the change.

#### example

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--      Copyright (c) 1991, Software Productivity Consortium, Inc.
--      All rights reserved.
--
-- Author: J. Smith
-- Department:System Software Department
--
-- Revision History:
--   7/9/91 J. Smith
--     - Added function Size_Of to support queries of node sizes.
--     - Fixed bug in Set_Size which caused overlap of large nodes.
--   7/1/91 M. Jones
--     - Optimized clipping algorithm for speed.
--   6/25/91 J. Smith
--     - Original version.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

Ownership information should be present in each file if you want to be
sure to protect your rights to the software. Furthermore, for high
visibility, it should be the first thing in the file.

Responsibility and revision history information should be present in
each file for the sake of future maintainers; this is the header
information most trusted by maintainers because it accumulates. It does
not evolve. There is no need to ever go back and modify the author's
name or the revision history of a file. As the code evolves, the
revision history should be updated to reflect each change. At worst, it
will be incomplete; it should rarely be wrong. Also, the number and
frequency of changes and the number of different people who made the
changes over the history of a unit can be good indicators of the
integrity of the implementation with respect to the design.

Information about how to find the original author should be included in
the file header, in addition to the author's name, to make it easier for
maintainers to find the author in case questions arise. However,
detailed information like phone numbers, mail stops, office numbers, and
computer account user names are too volatile to be very useful. It is
better to record the department for which the author was working when
the code was written. This information is still useful if the author
moves offices, changes departments, or even leaves the company because
the department is likely to retain responsibility for the original
version of the code.

#### notes

With modern configuration management systems, explicitly capturing
version history as header comments may be superfluous. The configuration
management tool maintains a more reliable and consistent (from a content
point of view) change history. Some systems can re-create earlier
versions of a unit.

### Program Unit Specification Headers

#### guideline

- Put a header on the specification of each program unit.
- Place information required by the user of the program unit in the
  specification header.
- Do not repeat information (except unit name) in the specification
  header that is present in the specification.
- Explain what the unit does, not how or why it does it.
- Describe the complete interface to the program unit, including any
  exceptions it can raise and any global effects it can have.
- Do not include information about how the unit fits into the
  enclosing software system.
- Describe the performance (time and space) characteristics of the
  unit.

#### instantiation

- Put the name of the program unit in the header.
- Briefly explain the purpose of the program unit.
- For packages, describe the effects of the visible subprograms on
  each other and how they should be used together.
- List all exceptions that can be raised by the unit.
- List all global effects of the unit.
- List preconditions and postconditions of the unit.
- List hidden tasks activated by the unit.
- Do not list the names of parameters of a subprogram.
- Do not list the names of package subprograms just to list them.
- Do not list the names of all other units used by the unit.
- Do not list the names of all other units that use the unit.

#### example

     -- AUTOLAYOUT
     --
     -- Purpose:
     --   This package computes positional information for nodes and arcs
     --   of a directed graph.  It encapsulates a layout algorithm which is
     --   designed to minimize the number of crossing arcs and to emphasize
     --   the primary direction of arc flow through the graph.
     --
     -- Effects:
     --   - The expected usage is:
     --     1. Call Define for each node and arc to define the graph.
     --     2. Call Layout to assign positions to all nodes and arcs.
     --     3. Call Position_Of for each node and arc to determine the
     --        assigned coordinate positions.
     --   - Layout can be called multiple times, and recomputes the
     --     positions of all currently defined nodes and arcs each time.
     --   - Once a node or arc has been defined, it remains defined until
     --     Clear is called to delete all nodes and arcs.
     --
     -- Performance:
     --   This package has been optimized for time, in preference to space.
     --   Layout times are on the order of N*log(N) where N is the number
     --   of nodes, but memory space is used inefficiently.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     package Autolayout is

        ...

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        -- Define
        --
        -- Purpose:
        --   This procedure defines one node of the current graph.
        -- Exceptions:
        --   Node_Already_Defined
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        procedure Define
              (New_Node : in     Node);

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        -- Layout
        --
        -- Purpose:
        --   This procedure assigns coordinate positions to all defined
        --   nodes and arcs.
        -- Exceptions:
        --   None.
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        procedure Layout;

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        -- Position_Of
        --
        -- Purpose:
        --   This function returns the coordinate position of the
        --   specified node.  The default position (0,0) is returned if no
        --   position has been assigned yet.
        -- Exceptions:
        --   Node_Not_Defined
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        function Position_Of (Current : in     Node)
              return Position;

        ...

     end Autolayout;
```

#### rationale

The purpose of a header comment on the specification of a program unit
is to help the user understand how to use the program unit. From reading
the program unit specification and header, a user should know everything
necessary to use the unit. It should not be necessary to read the body
of the program unit. Therefore, there should be a header comment on each
program unit specification, and each header should contain all usage
information not expressed in the specification itself. Such information
includes the units' effects on each other and on shared resources,
exceptions raised, and time/space characteristics. None of this
information can be determined from the Ada specification of the program
unit.

When you duplicate information in the header that can be readily
obtained from the specification, the information tends to become
incorrect during maintenance. For example, do not make a point of
listing all parameter names, modes, or subtypes when describing a
procedure. This information is already available from the procedure
specification. Similarly, do not list all subprograms of a package in
the header unless this is necessary to make some important statement
about the subprograms.

Do not include information in the header that the user of the program
unit does not need. In particular, do not include information about how
a program unit performs its function or why a particular algorithm was
used. This information should be hidden in the body of the program unit
to preserve the abstraction defined by the unit. If the user knows such
details and makes decisions based on that information, the code may
suffer when that information is later changed.

When describing the purpose of the unit, avoid referring to other parts
of the enclosing software system. It is better to say "this unit does…"
than to say "this unit is called by Xyz to do…." The unit should be
written in such a way that it does not know or care which unit is
calling it. This makes the unit much more general purpose and reusable.
In addition, information about other units is likely to become obsolete
and incorrect during maintenance.

Include information about the performance (time and space)
characteristics of the unit. Much of this information is not present in
the Ada specification, but it is required by the user. To integrate the
unit into a system, the user needs to understand the resource usage
(CPU, memory, etc.) of the unit. It is especially important to note that
when a subprogram call causes activation of a task hidden in a package
body, the task may continue to consume resources after the subroutine
ends.

#### notes

Some projects have deferred most of the commentary to the end rather
than at the beginning of the program unit. Their rationale is that
program units are written once and read many times and that long header
comments make the start of the specification difficult to find.

#### exceptions

Where a group of program units are closely related or simple to
understand, it is acceptable to use a single header for the entire group
of program units. For example, it makes sense to use a single header to
describe the behavior of Max and Min functions; Sin, Cos, and Tan
functions; or a group of functions to query related attributes of an
object encapsulated in a package. This is especially true when each
function in the set is capable of raising the same exceptions.

### Program Unit Body Headers

#### guideline

- Place information required by the maintainer of the program unit in
  the body of the header
- Explain how and why the unit performs its function, not what the
  unit does.
- Do not repeat information (except unit name) in the header that is
  readily apparent from reading the code.
- Do not repeat information (except unit name) in the body header that
  is available in the specification header.

#### instantiation

- Put the name of the program unit in the header.
- Record portability issues in the header.
- Summarize complex algorithms in the header.
- Record reasons for significant or controversial implementation
  decisions.
- Record discarded implementation alternatives, along with the reason
  for discarding them.
- Record anticipated changes in the header, especially if some work
  has already been done to the code to make the changes easy to
  accomplish.

-- Implementation Notes:
--   - This package uses a heuristic algorithm to minimize the number
--     of arc crossings.  It does not always achieve the true minimum

--     nearly perfect job in relatively little time.  For details about
--     the algorithm, see ...
--
-- Portability Issues:

-- Anticipated Changes:

--     with little effort.  Care has been taken to not depend on the
--     specific characteristics of integer arithmetic.

   --     technique was introduced as an optimization when the algorithm

         return Position is

   end Position_Of;

   ...

end Autolayout;
```

#### rationale

The purpose of a header comment on the body of a program unit is to help
the maintainer of the program unit to understand the implementation of
the unit, including tradeoffs among different techniques. Be sure to
document all decisions made during implementation to prevent the
maintainer from making the same mistakes you made. One of the most
valuable comments to a maintainer is a clear description of why a change
being considered will not work.

The header is also a good place to record portability concerns. The
maintainer may have to port the software to a different environment and
will benefit from a list of nonportable features. Furthermore, the act
of collecting and recording portability issues focuses attention on
these issues and may result in more portable code from the start.

Summarize complex algorithms in the header if the code is difficult to
read or understand without such a summary, but do not merely paraphrase
the code. Such duplication is unnecessary and hard to maintain.
Similarly, do not repeat the information from the header of the program
unit specification.

#### notes

It is often the case that a program unit is self-explanatory so that it
does not require a body header to explain how it is implemented or why.
In such a case, omit the header entirely, as in the case with
Position_Of above. Be sure, however, that the header you omit truly
contains no information. For example, consider the difference between
the two header sections:

```ada
-- Implementation Notes:  None.
```

and:

```ada
-- NonPortable Features:  None.
```

The first is a message from the author to the maintainer saying "I can't
think of anything else to tell you," while the second may mean "I
guarantee that this unit is entirely portable."

### Data Comments

#### guideline

- Comment on all data types, objects, and exceptions unless their
  names are self-explanatory.
- Include information on the semantic structure of complex,
  pointer-based data structures.
- Include information about relationships that are maintained between
  data objects.
- Omit comments that merely repeat the information in the name.
- Include information on redispatching for tagged types in cases where
  you intend the specializations (i.e., derived types) to override
  these redispatching operations.

#### example

Objects can be grouped by purpose and commented as:

```ada
...

---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Current position of the cursor in the currently selected text
-- buffer, and the most recent position explicitly marked by the
-- user.
-- Note:  It is necessary to maintain both current and desired
--        column positions because the cursor cannot always be
--        displayed in the desired position when moving between
--        lines of different lengths.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Desired_Column : Column_Counter;
Current_Column : Column_Counter;
Current_Row    : Row_Counter;
Marked_Column  : Column_Counter;
Marked_Row     : Row_Counter;
```

The conditions under which an exception is raised should be commented:

```ada
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Exceptions
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Node_Already_Defined : exception;   -- Raised when an attempt is made
                                    --|   to define a node with an
                                    --|   identifier which already
                                    --|   defines a node.
Node_Not_Defined     : exception;   -- Raised when a reference is
                                    --|   made to a node which has
                                    --|   not been defined.
```

Here is a more complex example, involving multiple record and access
types that are used to form a complex data structure:

```ada
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- These data structures are used to store the graph during the
-- layout process. The overall organization is a sorted list of
-- "ranks," each containing a sorted list of nodes, each containing
-- a list of incoming arcs and a list of outgoing arcs.
-- The lists are doubly linked to support forward and backward
-- passes for sorting. Arc lists do not need to be doubly linked
-- because order of arcs is irrelevant.
--
-- The nodes and arcs are doubly linked to each other to support
-- efficient lookup of all arcs to/from a node, as well as efficient
-- lookup of the source/target node of an arc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

type Arc;
type Arc_Pointer is access Arc;

type Node;
type Node_Pointer is access Node;

type Node is
   record
      Id       : Node_Pointer;-- Unique node ID supplied by the user.
      Arc_In   : Arc_Pointer;
      Arc_Out  : Arc_Pointer;
      Next     : Node_Pointer;
      Previous : Node_Pointer;
   end record;

type Arc is
   record
      ID     : Arc_ID;        -- Unique arc ID supplied by the user.
      Source : Node_Pointer;
      Target : Node_Pointer;
      Next   : Arc_Pointer;
   end record;

type Rank;
type Rank_Pointer is access Rank;

type Rank is
   record
      Number     : Level_ID;  -- Computed ordinal number of the rank.
      First_Node : Node_Pointer;
      Last_Node  : Node_Pointer;
      Next       : Rank_Pointer;
      Previous   : Rank_Pointer;
   end record;

First_Rank : Rank_Pointer;
Last_Rank  : Rank_Pointer;
```

#### rationale

It is very useful to add comments explaining the purpose, structure, and
semantics of the data structures. Many maintainers look at the data
structures first when trying to understand the implementation of a unit.
Understanding the data that can be stored, along with the relationships
between the different data items and the flow of data through the unit,
is an important first step in understanding the details of the unit.

In the first example above, the names Current_Column and Current_Row
are relatively self-explanatory. The name Desired_Column is also well
chosen, but it leaves the reader wondering what the relationship is
between the current column and the desired column. The comment explains
the reason for having both.

Another advantage of commenting on the data declarations is that the
single set of comments on a declaration can replace multiple sets of
comments that might otherwise be needed at various places in the code
where the data is manipulated. In the first example above, the comment
briefly expands on the meaning of "current" and "marked." It states that
the "current" position is the location of the cursor, the "current"
position is in the current buffer, and the "marked" position was marked
by the user. This comment, along with the mnemonic names of the
variables, greatly reduces the need for comments at individual
statements throughout the code.

It is important to document the full meaning of exceptions and under
what conditions they can be raised, as shown in the second example
above, especially when the exceptions are declared in a package
specification. The reader has no other way to find out the exact meaning
of the exception (without reading the code in the package body).

Grouping all the exceptions together, as shown in the second example,
can provide the reader with the effect of a "glossary" of special
conditions. This is useful when many different subprograms in the
package can raise the same exceptions. For a package in which each
exception can be raised by only one subprogram, it may be better to
group related subprograms and exceptions together.

When commenting exceptions, it is better to describe the exception's
meaning in general terms than to list all the subprograms that can cause
the exception to be raised; such a list is harder to maintain. When a
new routine is added, it is likely that these lists will not be updated.
Also, this information is already present in the comments describing the
subprograms, where all exceptions that can be raised by the subprogram
should be listed. Lists of exceptions by subprogram are more useful and
easier to maintain than lists of subprograms by exception.

In the third example, the names of the record fields are short and
mnemonic, but they are not completely self-explanatory. This is often
the case with complex data structures involving access types. There is
no way to choose the record and field names so that they completely
explain the overall organization of the records and pointers into a
nested set of sorted lists. The comments shown are useful in this case.
Without them, the reader would not know which lists are sorted, which
lists are doubly linked, or why. The comments express the intent of the
author with respect to this complex data structure. The maintainer still
has to read the code if he wants to be sure that the double links are
all properly maintained. Keeping this in mind when reading the code
makes it much easier for the maintainer to find a bug where one pointer
is updated and the opposite one is not.

See Guideline 9.3.1 for the rationale for documenting the use of
redispatching operations. (Redispatching means converting an argument of
one primitive operation to a class-wide type and making a dispatching
call to another primitive operation.) The rationale in Guideline 9.3.1
discusses whether such documentation should be in the specification or
the body.

### Statement Comments

#### guideline

- Minimize comments embedded among statements.
- Use comments only to explain parts of the code that are not obvious.
- Comment intentional omissions from the code.
- Do not use comments to paraphrase the code.
- Do not use comments to explain remote pieces of code, such as
  subprograms called by the current unit.
- Where comments are necessary, make them visually distinct from the
  code.

#### example

The following is an example of very poorly commented code:

```ada
...

-- Loop through all the strings in the array Strings, converting
-- them to integers by calling Convert_To_Integer on each one,
-- accumulating the sum of all the values in Sum, and counting them
-- in Count.  Then divide Sum by Count to get the average and store
-- it in Average. Also, record the maximum number in the global
-- variable Max_Number.

for I in Strings'Range loop
   -- Convert each string to an integer value by looping through
   -- the characters which are digits, until a nondigit is found,
   -- taking the ordinal value of each, subtracting the ordinal value
   -- of '0', and multiplying by 10 if another digit follows.  Store
   -- the result in Number.
   Number := Convert_To_Integer(Strings(I));
   -- Accumulate the sum of the numbers in Total.
   Sum := Sum + Number;
   -- Count the numbers.
   Count := Count + 1;

   -- Decide whether this number is more than the current maximum.
   if Number > Max_Number then
      -- Update the global variable Max_Number.
      Max_Number := Number;
   end if;

end loop;
-- Compute the average.
Average := Sum / Count;
```

The following is improved by not repeating things in the comments that
are obvious from the code, not describing the details of what goes in
inside of `Convert_To_Integer`, deleting an erroneous comment (the one
on the statement that accumulates the sum), and making the few remaining
comments more visually distinct from the code.

```ada
Sum_Integers_Converted_From_Strings:
   for I in Strings'Range loop
      Number := Convert_To_Integer(Strings(I));
      Sum := Sum + Number;
      Count := Count + 1;

      -- The global Max_Number is computed here for efficiency.
      if Number > Max_Number then
         Max_Number := Number;
      end if;

   end loop Sum_Integers_Converted_From_Strings;

Average := Sum / Count;
```

#### rationale

The improvements shown in the example are not improvements merely by
reducing the total number of comments; they are improvements by reducing
the number of useless comments.

Comments that paraphrase or explain obvious aspects of the code have no
value. They are a waste of effort for the author to write and the
maintainer to update. Therefore, they often end up becoming incorrect.
Such comments also clutter the code, hiding the few important comments.

Comments describing what goes on inside another unit violate the
principle of information hiding. The details about Convert_To_Integer
(deleted above) are irrelevant to the calling unit, and they are better
left hidden in case the algorithm ever changes. Examples explaining what
goes on elsewhere in the code are very difficult to maintain and almost
always become incorrect at the first code modification.

The advantage of making comments visually distinct from the code is that
it makes the code easier to scan, and the few important comments stand
out better. Highlighting unusual or special code features indicates that
they are intentional. This assists maintainers by focusing attention on
code sections that are likely to cause problems during maintenance or
when porting the program to another implementation.

Comments should be used to document code that is nonportable,
implementation-dependent, environment-dependent, or tricky in any way.
They notify the reader that something unusual was put there for a
reason. A beneficial comment would be one explaining a work around for a
compiler bug. If you use a lower level (not "ideal" in the software
engineering sense) solution, comment on it. Information included in the
comments should state why you used that particular construct. Also
include documentation on the failed attempts, for example, using a
higher level structure. This kind of comment is useful to maintainers
for historical purposes. You show the reader that a significant amount
of thought went into the choice of a construct.

Finally, comments should be used to explain what is not present in the
code as well as what is present. If you make a conscious decision to not
perform some action, like deallocating a data structure with which you
appear to be finished, be sure to add a comment explaining why not.
Otherwise, a maintainer may notice the apparent omission and "correct"
it later, thus introducing an error.

See also Guideline 9.3.1 for a discussion of what kind of documentation
you should provide regarding tagged types and redispatching.

#### notes

Further improvements can be made on the above example by declaring the
variables Count and Sum in a local block so that their scope is limited
and their initializations occur near their usage, e.g., by naming the
block Compute_Average or by moving the code into a function called
Average_Of. The computation of Max_Number can also be separated from
the computation of Average. However, those changes are the subject of
other guidelines; this example is only intended to illustrate the proper
use of comments.

### Marker Comments

#### guideline

- Use pagination markers to mark program unit boundaries (see
  Guideline 2.1.7).
- Repeat the unit name in a comment to mark the `begin` of a package
  body, subprogram body, task body, or block if the `begin` is
  preceded by declarations.
- For long or heavily nested `if` and `case` statements, mark the end
  of the statement with a comment summarizing the condition governing
  the statement.
- For long or heavily nested `if` statements, mark the `else` part
  with a comment summarizing the conditions governing this portion of
  the statement.

#### example

```ada
if    A_Found then
   ...
elsif B_Found then
   ...

else  -- A and B were both not found
   ...

   if Count = Max then
      ...

   end if;

   ...
end if;  -- A_Found

------------------------------------------------------------------------
package body Abstract_Strings is
   ...

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   procedure Concatenate (...) is
   begin
      ...
   end Concatenate;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   ...
begin  -- Abstract_Strings
   ...
end Abstract_Strings;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

Marker comments emphasize the structure of code and make it easier to
scan. They can be lines that separate sections of code or descriptive
tags for a construct. They help the reader resolve questions about the
current position in the code. This is more important for large units
than for small ones. A short marker comment fits on the same line as the
reserved word with which it is associated. Thus, it adds information
without clutter.

The `if`, `elsif`, `else`, and `end if` of an `if` statement are often
separated by long sequences of statements, sometimes involving other
`if` statements. As shown in the first example, marker comments
emphasize the association of the keywords of the same statement over a
great visual distance. Marker comments are not necessary with the block
statement and loop statement because the syntax of these statements
allows them to be named with the name repeated at the end. Using these
names is better than using marker comments because the compiler verifies
that the names at the beginning and end match.

The sequence of statements of a package body is often very far from the
first line of the package. Many subprogram bodies, each containing many
`begin` lines, may occur first. As shown in the second example, the
marker comment emphasizes the association of the begin with the package.

#### notes

Repeating names and noting conditional expressions clutters the code if
overdone. It is visual distance, especially page breaks, that makes
marker comments beneficial.
