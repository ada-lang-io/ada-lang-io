title: 3.1 Spelling
---

Spelling conventions in source code include rules for capitalization and
use of underscores, numbers, and abbreviations. If you follow these
conventions consistently, the resulting code is clearer and more
readable.

### Use of Underscores

#### guideline

- Use underscores to separate words in a compound name.

#### example

```none
Miles_Per_Hour
Entry_Value
```

#### rationale

When an identifier consists of more than one word, it is much easier to
read if the words are separated by underscores. Indeed, there is
precedent in English in which compound words are separated by a hyphen
or a space. In addition to promoting readability of the code, if
underscores are used in names, a code formatter has more control over
altering capitalization. See Guideline 3.1.3.

### Numbers

#### guideline

- Represent numbers in a consistent fashion.
- Represent literals in a radix appropriate to the problem.
- Use underscores to separate digits the same way commas or periods
  (or spaces for nondecimal bases) would be used in normal text.
- When using scientific notation, make the E consistently either
  uppercase or lowercase.
- In an alternate base, represent the alphabetic characters in either
  all uppercase or all lowercase.

#### instantiation

- Decimal and octal numbers are grouped by threes beginning on the
  left side of the radix point and by fives beginning on the right
  side of the radix point.
- The E is always capitalized in scientific notation.
- Use uppercase for the alphabetic characters representing digits in
  bases above 10.
- Hexadecimal numbers are grouped by fours beginning on either side of
  the radix point.

#### example

```ada
type Maximum_Samples     is range          1 ..  1_000_000;
type Legal_Hex_Address   is range   16#0000# ..   16#FFFF#;
type Legal_Octal_Address is range 8#000_000# .. 8#777_777#;

Avogadro_Number : constant := 6.02216_9E+23;
```

To represent the number 1/3 as a constant, use:

```ada
One_Third : constant := 1.0 / 3.0;
```

Avoid this use:

```ada
One_Third_As_Decimal_Approximation : constant := 0.33333_33333_3333;
```

or:

```ada
One_Third_Base_3 : constant := 3#0.1#;
```

#### rationale

Consistent use of uppercase or lowercase aids scanning for numbers.
Underscores serve to group portions of numbers into familiar patterns.
Consistency with common use in everyday contexts is a large part of
readability.

#### notes

If a rational fraction is represented in a base in which it has a
terminating rather than a repeating representation, as 3\#0.1\# does in
the example above, it may have increased accuracy upon conversion to the
machine base. (This is wrong for named numbers as in this example - they
must be calculated exactly.)

### Capitalization

#### guideline

- Make reserved words and other elements of the program visually
  distinct from each other.

#### instantiation

- Use lowercase for all reserved words (when used as reserved words).
- Use mixed case for all other identifiers, a capital letter beginning
  every word separated by underscores.
- Use uppercase for abbreviations and acronyms (see automation notes).

#### example

```ada
...

type Second_Of_Day      is range 0 .. 86_400;
type Noon_Relative_Time is (Before_Noon, After_Noon, High_Noon);

subtype Morning   is Second_Of_Day range 0 .. 86_400 / 2 - 1;
subtype Afternoon is Second_Of_Day range Morning'Last + 2 .. 86_400;

...

Current_Time := Second_Of_Day(Calendar.Seconds(Calendar.Clock));
if Current_Time in Morning then
   Time_Of_Day := Before_Noon;
elsif Current_Time in Afternoon then
   Time_Of_Day := After_Noon;
else
   Time_Of_Day := High_Noon;
end if;

case Time_Of_Day is
   when Before_Noon =>   Get_Ready_For_Lunch;
   when High_Noon   =>   Eat_Lunch;
   when After_Noon  =>   Get_To_Work;
end case;

...
```

#### rationale

Visually distinguishing reserved words allows you to focus on program
structure alone, if desired, and also aids scanning for particular
identifiers.

The instantiation chosen here is meant to be more readable for the
experienced Ada programmer, who does not need reserved words to leap off
the page. Beginners to any language often find that reserved words
should be emphasized to help them find the control structures more
easily. Because of this, instructors in the classroom and books
introducing the Ada language may want to consider an alternative
instantiation. The Ada Reference Manual (1995) chose bold lowercase for
all reserved words.

#### automation notes

Ada names are not case sensitive. Therefore, the names `max_limit`,
`MAX_LIMIT`, and `Max_Limit` denote the same object or entity. A good
code formatter should be able to automatically convert from one style to
another as long as the words are delimited by underscores.

As recommended in Guideline 3.1.4, abbreviations should be project-wide.
An automated tool should allow a project to specify those abbreviations
and format them accordingly.

### Abbreviations

#### guideline

- Do not use an abbreviation of a long word as an identifier where a
  shorter synonym exists.
- Use a consistent abbreviation strategy.
- Do not use ambiguous abbreviations.
- To justify its use, an abbreviation must save many characters over
  the full word.
- Use abbreviations that are well-accepted in the application domain.
- Maintain a list of accepted abbreviations, and use only
  abbreviations on that list.

#### example

Use:

```ada
Time_Of_Receipt
```

rather than:

```ada
Recd_Time or R_Time
```

But in an application that commonly deals with message formats that meet
military standards, `DOD_STD_MSG_FMT` is an acceptable abbreviation for:

```ada
Department_Of_Defense_Standard_Message_Format.
```

#### rationale

Many abbreviations are ambiguous or unintelligible unless taken in
context. As an example, Temp could indicate either temporary or
temperature. For this reason, you should choose abbreviations carefully
when you use them. The rationale in Guideline 8.1.2 provides a more
thorough discussion of how context should influence the use of
abbreviations.

Because very long variable names can obscure the structure of the
program, especially in deeply nested (indented) control structures, it
is a good idea to try to keep identifiers short and meaningful. Use
short unabbreviated names whenever possible. If there is no short word
that will serve as an identifier, then a well-known unambiguous
abbreviation is the next best choice, especially if it comes from a list
of standard abbreviations used throughout the project.

You can establish an abbreviated format for a fully qualified name using
the renames clause. This capability is useful when a very long, fully
qualified name would otherwise occur many times in a localized section
of code (see Guideline 5.7.2).

A list of accepted abbreviations for a project provides a standard
context for using each abbreviation.
