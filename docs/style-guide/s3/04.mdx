title: 3.4 Using Types
---

Strong typing promotes reliability in software. The type definition of
an object defines all legal values and operations and allows the
compiler to check for and identify potential errors during compilation.
In addition, the rules of type allow the compiler to generate code to
check for violations of type constraints at execution time. Using these
Ada compiler's features facilitates earlier and more complete error
detection than that which is available with less strongly typed
languages.

### Declaring Types

#### guideline

- Limit the range of scalar types as much as possible.
- Seek information about possible values from the application.
- Do not reuse any of the subtype names in package `Standard`.
- Use subtype declarations to improve program readability (Booch 1987).
- Use derived types and subtypes in concert (see Guideline 5.3.1).

#### example

```ada
subtype Card_Image is String (1 .. 80);
Input_Line : Card_Image := (others => ' ');
-- restricted integer type:
type    Day_Of_Leap_Year     is                  range 1 .. 366;
subtype Day_Of_Non_Leap_Year is Day_Of_Leap_Year range 1 .. 365;
```

By the following declaration, the programmer means, "I haven't the
foggiest idea how many," but the actual base range will show up buried
in the code or as a system parameter:

```ada
Employee_Count : Integer;
```

#### rationale

Eliminating meaningless values from the legal range improves the
compiler's ability to detect errors when an object is set to an invalid
value. This also improves program readability. In addition, it forces
you to carefully think about each use of objects declared to be of the
subtype.

Different implementations provide different sets of values for most of
the predefined types. A reader cannot determine the intended range from
the predefined names. This situation is aggravated when the predefined
names are overloaded.

The names of an object and its subtype can clarify their intended use
and document low-level design decisions. The example above documents a
design decision to restrict the software to devices whose physical
parameters are derived from the characteristics of punch cards. This
information is easy to find for any later changes, thus enhancing
program maintainability.

You can rename a type by declaring a subtype without a constraint ([Ada
Reference Manual, §8.5](../../arm/AA-8/AA-8.5.mdx)). You cannot overload a
subtype name; overloading only applies to callable entities. Enumeration
literals are treated as parameterless functions and so are included in
this rule.

Types can have highly constrained sets of values without eliminating
useful values. Usage as described in Guideline 5.3.1 eliminates many
flag variables and type conversions within executable statements. This
renders the program more readable while allowing the compiler to enforce
strong typing constraints.

#### notes

Subtype declarations do not define new types, only constraints for
existing types.

Any deviation from this guideline detracts from the advantages of the
strong typing facilities of the Ada language.

#### exceptions

There are cases where you do not have a particular dependence on any
range of numeric values. Such situations occur, for example, with array
indices (e.g., a list whose size is not fixed by any particular
semantics). See Guideline 7.2.1 for a discussion of appropriate uses of
predefined types.

### Enumeration Types

#### guideline

- Use enumeration types instead of numeric codes.
- Only if absolutely necessary, use representation clauses to match
  requirements of external devices.

#### example

Use:

```ada
type Color is (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow);
```

rather than:

```ada
Blue   : constant := 1;
Red    : constant := 2;
Green  : constant := 3;
Yellow : constant := 4;
```

and add the following if necessary:

```ada
for Color use (Blue   => 1,
               Red    => 2,
               Green  => 3,
               Yellow => 4);
```

#### rationale

Enumerations are more robust than numeric codes; they leave less
potential for errors resulting from incorrect interpretation and from
additions to and deletions from the set of values during maintenance.
Numeric codes are holdovers from languages that have no user-defined
types.

In addition, Ada provides a number of attributes (`'Pos`, `'Val`,
`'Succ`, `'Pred`, `'Image`, and `'Value`) for enumeration types that,
when used, are more reliable than user-written operations on encodings.

A numeric code may at first seem appropriate to match external values.
Instead, these situations call for a representation clause on the
enumeration type. The representation clause documents the "encoding." If
the program is properly structured to isolate and encapsulate hardware
dependencies (see Guideline 7.1.5), the numeric code ends up in an
interface package where it can be easily found and replaced if the
requirements change.

In general, avoid using representation clauses for enumeration types.
When there is no obvious ordering of the enumeration literals, an
enumeration representation can create portability problems if the
enumeration type must be reordered to accommodate a change in
representation order on the new platform.
