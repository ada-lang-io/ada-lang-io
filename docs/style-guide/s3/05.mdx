title: 3.5 Summary
---

### spelling

- Use underscores to separate words in a compound name.
- Represent numbers in a consistent fashion.
- Represent literals in a radix appropriate to the problem.
- Use underscores to separate digits the same way commas or periods
  (or spaces for nondecimal bases) would be used in normal text.
- When using scientific notation, make the E consistently either
  uppercase or lowercase.
- In an alternate base, represent the alphabetic characters in either
  all uppercase or all lowercase.
- Make reserved words and other elements of the program visually
  distinct from each other.
- Do not use an abbreviation of a long word as an identifier where a
  shorter synonym exists.
- Use a consistent abbreviation strategy.
- Do not use ambiguous abbreviations.
- To justify its use, an abbreviation must save many characters over
  the full word.
- Use abbreviations that are well-accepted in the application domain.
- Maintain a list of accepted abbreviations, and use only
  abbreviations on that list.

### naming conventions

- Choose names that are as self-documenting as possible.
- Use a short synonym instead of an abbreviation.
- Use names given by the application, but do not use obscure jargon.
- Avoid using the same name to declare different kinds of identifiers.
- Use singular, general nouns as subtype identifiers.
- Choose identifiers that describe one of the subtype's values.
- Consider using suffixes for subtype identifiers that define visible
  access types, visible subranges, or visible array types.
- For private types, do not use identifier constructions (e.g.,
  suffixes) that are unique to subtype identifiers.
- Do not use the subtype names from predefined packages.
- Use predicate clauses or adjectives for Boolean objects.
- Use singular, specific nouns as object identifiers.
- Choose identifiers that describe the object's value during
  execution.
- Use singular, general nouns as identifiers for record components.
- Use a consistent naming convention for tagged types and associated
  packages.
- Use action verbs for procedures and entries.
- Use predicate clauses for Boolean functions.
- Use nouns for non-Boolean functions.
- Give packages names that imply a higher level of organization than
  subprograms. Generally, these are noun phrases that describe the
  abstraction provided.
- Give tasks names that imply an active entity.
- Use nouns descriptive of the data being protected for protected
  units.
- Consider naming generic subprograms as if they were nongeneric
  subprograms.
- Consider naming generic packages as if they were nongeneric
  packages.
- Make the generic names more general than the instantiated names.
- Use symbolic values instead of literals, wherever possible.
- Use the predefined constants Ada.Numerics.Pi and Ada.Numerics.e for
  the mathematical constants Pi and e.
- Use constants instead of variables for constant values.
- Use a constant when the value is specific to a type or when the
  value must be static.
- Use named numbers instead of constants, whenever possible.
- Use named numbers to replace numeric literals whose type or context
  is truly universal.
- Use constants for objects whose values cannot change after
  elaboration. (United Technologies 1987).
- Show relationships between symbolic values by defining them with
  static expressions.
- Use linearly independent sets of literals.
- Use attributes like 'First and 'Last instead of literals, wherever
  possible.
- Use a name that indicates the kind of problem the exception
  represents.
- Include a prefix like New, Make, or Create in naming constructors
  (in this sense, operations to create and/or initialize an object).
- Use names indicative of their content for child packages containing
  constructors.

### comments

- Make the code as clear as possible to reduce the need for comments.
- Never repeat information in a comment that is readily available in
  the code.
- Where a comment is required, make it concise and complete.
- Use proper grammar and spelling in comments.
- Make comments visually distinct from the code.
- Structure comments in headers so that information can be
  automatically extracted by a tool.
- Put a file header on each source file.
- Place ownership, responsibility, and history information for the
  file in the file header.
- Put a header on the specification of each program unit.
- Place information required by the user of the program unit in the
  specification header.
- Do not repeat information (except unit name) in the specification
  header that is present in the specification.
- Explain what the unit does, not how or why it does it.
- Describe the complete interface to the program unit, including any
  exceptions it can raise and any global effects it can have.
- Do not include information about how the unit fits into the
  enclosing software system.
- Describe the performance (time and space) characteristics of the
  unit.
- Place information required by the maintainer of the program unit in
  the body header.
- Explain how and why the unit performs its function, not what the
  unit does.
- Do not repeat information (except unit name) in the header that is
  readily apparent from reading the code.
- Do not repeat information (except unit name) in the body header that
  is available in the specification header.
- Comment on all data types, objects, and exceptions unless their
  names are self-explanatory.
- Include information on the semantic structure of complex,
  pointer-based data structures.
- Include information about relationships that are maintained between
  data objects.
- Omit comments that merely repeat the information in the name.
- Include information on redispatching for tagged types in cases where
  you intend the specializations (i.e., derived types) to override
  these redispatching operations.
- Minimize comments embedded among statements.
- Use comments only to explain parts of the code that are not obvious.
- Comment intentional omissions from the code.
- Do not use comments to paraphrase the code.
- Do not use comments to explain remote pieces of code, such as
  subprograms called by the current unit.
- Where comments are necessary, make them visually distinct from the
  code.
- Use pagination markers to mark program unit boundaries.
- Repeat the unit name in a comment to mark the begin of a package
  body, subprogram body, task body, or block if the begin is preceded
  by declarations.
- For long or heavily nested if and case statements, mark the end of
  the statement with a comment summarizing the condition governing the
  statement.
- For long or heavily nested if statements, mark the else part with a
  comment summarizing the conditions governing this portion of the
  statement.

### using types

- Limit the range of scalar types as much as possible.
- Seek information about possible values from the application.
- Do not reuse any of the subtype names in package Standard.
- Use subtype declarations to improve program readability (Booch
  1987).
- Use derived types and subtypes in concert.
- Use enumeration types instead of numeric codes.
- Only if absolutely necessary, use representation clauses to match
  requirements of external devices.
