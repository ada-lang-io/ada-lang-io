title: 7.1 Fundamentals
---

This section introduces some generally applicable principles of writing
portable Ada programs. It includes guidelines about the assumptions you
should make with respect to a number of Ada features and their
implementations and guidelines about the use of other Ada features to
ensure maximum portability.

### Obsolescent Features

#### guideline

- In programs or components intended to have a long life, avoid using
  the features of Ada declared as "obsolescent" by Annex J of the Ada
  Reference Manual (1995), unless the use of the feature is needed for
  backward compatibility with Ada 83 (Ada Reference Manual 1983).
- Document the use of any obsolescent features.
- Avoid using the following features:
  - The short renamings of the packages in the predefined
    environment (e.g., Text_IO as opposed to Ada.Text_IO)
  - The character replacements of \! for |, : for \#, and % for
    quotation marks
  - Reduced accuracy subtypes of floating-point types
  - The 'Constrained attribute as applied to private types
  - The predefined package ASCII
  - The exception Numeric_Error
  - Various representation specifications, including at clauses, mod
    clauses, interrupt entries, and the Storage_Size attribute

#### rationale

Ten years of reflection on the use of Ada 83 led to the conclusion that
some features of the original language are not as useful as originally
intended. These features have been replaced with others in the Ada 95
revision. It would have been desirable to remove the obsolescent
features completely, but that would have prevented the upward compatible
transition of programs from Ada 83 to Ada 95. Thus, the obsolescent
features remain in the language and are explicitly labeled as such in
Annex J of the Ada Reference Manual (1995). The features listed in Annex
J are candidates for removal from the language during its next revision.
If a program's lifetime may extend beyond the next language revision, it
should avoid the obsolescent language features unless backward
compatibility with Ada 83 forces their use.

#### exceptions

When you instantiate Ada.Text_IO.Float_IO, the values of the
Default_Fore and Default_Aft fields are set from the values of the
'Fore and 'Aft attributes of the actual floating-point type used in the
instantiation. If you declare a reduced accuracy floating-point type
that you then use to instantiate Ada.Text_IO.Float_IO, the output
field widths are determined from the reduced accuracy type, although the
implementation accuracy is unchanged (Rationale 1995, ยง3.3).

### Global Assumptions

#### guideline

- Make informed assumptions about the support provided for the
  following on potential target platforms:
  - Number of bits available for type Integer (range constraints)
  - Number of decimal digits of precision available for
    floating-point types
  - Number of bits available for fixed-point types (delta and range
    constraints)
  - Number of characters per line of source text
  - Number of bits for Root_Integer expressions
  - Number of seconds for the range of Duration
  - Number of milliseconds for Duration'Small
  - Minimum and maximum scale for decimal types
- Avoid assumptions about the values and the number of values included
  in the type Character.

#### instantiation

- These are minimum values (or minimum precision in the case of
  Duration'Small) that a project or application might assume that an
  implementation provides. There is no guarantee that a given
  implementation provides more than the minimum, so these would be
  treated by the project or application as maximum values also.
  - 16 bits available for type Integer (-2\*\*15 .. 2\*\*15 - 1)
  - 6 decimal digits of precision available for floating-point types
  - 24 bits available for fixed-point types
  - 200 characters per line of source text
  - 16 bits for expressions
  - \-86_400 .. 86_400 seconds (1 day) for the range of Duration
    (as specified in Ada Reference Manual \[1995, ยง9.6\])
  - 20 milliseconds for Duration'Small (as specified in Ada
    Reference Manual \[1995, ยง9.6\])

#### rationale

Some assumptions must be made with respect to certain
implementation-specific values. The exact values assumed should cover
the majority of the target equipment of interest. Choosing the lowest
common denominator for values improves portability. Implementations may
supply an alternate character set specific to a locale or environment.
For instance, the implementation on an IBM-compatible PC may support
that machine's native character set rather than Latin 1. As a result,
some character values may or may not be supported, for example, the
smiley face.

#### notes

Of the microcomputers currently available for incorporation within
embedded systems, 16-bit and 32-bit processors are prevalent. Using
current representation schemes, 6 decimal digits of floating point
accuracy imply a representation mantissa at least 21 bits wide, leaving
11 bits for exponent and sign within a 32-bit representation. This
correlates with the data widths of floating point hardware currently
available for the embedded systems market. A 32-bit minimum on
fixed-point numbers correlates with the accuracy and storage
requirements of floating point numbers. The 16-bit example for
Root_Integer expressions matches that for Integer storage. (The 32-bit
integers can be assumed if the application will only be considered for
32-bit processors with a corresponding 32-bit operating system and
supporting compiler.)

The values for the range and accuracy of values of the predefined type
Duration are the limits expressed in the Ada Reference Manual (1995,
ยง9.6). You should not expect an implementation to provide a wider range
or a finer granularity.

A standard-mode Ada character set of Latin 1 can be assumed in most
cases for the contents and internal behavior of type Character and
packages Character.Latin_1, Character.Handling, and Strings.Maps.
However, this does not mean that the target hardware platform is capable
of displaying the entire character set. You should not use a nonstandard
Ada character set unless intentionally producing a nonportable user
interface with a specific purpose.

### Comments

#### guideline

- Use highlighting comments for each package, subprogram, and task
  where any nonportable features are present.
- For each nonportable feature employed, describe the expectations for
  that feature.

#### example

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
package Memory_Mapped_IO is
   -- WARNING - This package is implementation specific.
   -- It uses absolute memory addresses to interface with the I/O
   -- system. It assumes a particular printer's line length.
   -- Change memory mapping and printer details when porting.
   Printer_Line_Length : constant := 132;
   type Data is array (1 .. Printer_Line_Length) of Character;
   procedure Write_Line (Line : in     Data);
end Memory_Mapped_IO;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
with System;
with System.Storage_Elements;
package body Memory_Mapped_IO is
   -- WARNING: Implementation specific memory address

   Buffer_Address : constant System.Address
      := System.Storage_Elements.To_Address(16#200#);

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   procedure Write_Line (Line : in     Data) is
      Buffer : Data;
      for Buffer'Address use Buffer_Address;

   begin  -- Write_Line
       -- perform output operation through specific memory locations.
       ...
   end Write_Line;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
end Memory_Mapped_IO;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### rationale

Explicitly commenting each breach of portability will raise its
visibility and aid in the porting process. A description of the
nonportable feature's expectations covers the common case where vendor
documentation of the original implementation is not available to the
person performing the porting process.

### Main Subprogram

#### guideline

- Consider using only a parameterless procedure as the main
  subprogram.
- Consider using Ada.Command_Line for accessing values from the
  environment, but recognize that this package's behavior and even its
  specification are nonportable (see Guideline 7.1.6).
- Encapsulate and document all uses of package Ada.Command_Line.

#### example

The following example encapsulates the arguments for a hypothetical
"execution mode" argument passed from the environment. It encapsulates
both the expected position and the expected values of the argument, as
well as provides a default in cases where the environment was unable to
provide the information:

```ada
package Environment is

   type Execution_Mode is (Unspecified, Interactive, Batch);

   function Execution_Argument return Execution_Mode;

   ...

end Environment;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

with Ada.Command_Line;       use Ada.Command_Line;
with Ada.Strings.Unbounded;  use Ada.Strings.Unbounded;

package body Environment is

   function Execution_Argument return Execution_Mode is

      Execution_Argument_Number : constant := 1;

      Interactive_Mode_String : constant String := "-i";
      Batch_Mode_String       : constant String := "-b";

   begin
      if Argument_Count < Execution_Argument_Number then
         return Unspecified;
      elsif To_Unbounded_String (Argument (Execution_Argument_Number)) =
               Interactive_Mode_String then
         return Interactive;
      elsif To_Unbounded_String (Argument (Execution_Argument_Number)) =
               Batch_Mode_String then
         return Batch;
      else
         return Unspecified;
      end if;
   end Execution_Argument;

end Environment;
```

#### rationale

The predefined language environment declares the package
Ada.Command_Line, providing a standardized way for a program to obtain
the values of a command line. Because all Ada compilers must implement
the packages in the predefined language environment, you can create a
program that is more portable, maintainable, and readable by using this
package. You should, however, be aware that even though the language
defines the objects and type profiles of this package, it does not force
a relationship between the function results and any other entity or
operation, and thus, allows the possibility of a nonportable behavior
and specification.

The value returned by the function Ada.Command_Line.Argument_Count is
implementation-dependent. Different operating systems follow different
conventions regarding the parsing and meaning of command line
parameters. To enhance your program's portability, assume the simplest
case: that the external execution environment does not support passing
arguments to a program.

Some operating systems are capable of acquiring and interpreting
returned integer values near 0 from a function, but many others cannot.
Further, many real-time, embedded systems will not be designed to
terminate, so a function or a procedure having parameters with modes out
or in out will be inappropriate to such applications.

This leaves procedures with in parameters. Although some operating
systems can pass parameters into a program as it starts, others are not.
Also, an implementation may not be able to perform type checking on such
parameters even if the surrounding environment is capable of providing
them.

#### notes

Real-time, embedded applications may not have an "operator" initiating
the program to supply the parameters, in which case it would be more
appropriate for the program to have been compiled with a package
containing the appropriate constant values or for the program to read
the necessary values from switch settings or a downloaded auxiliary
file. In any case, the variation in surrounding initiating environments
is far too great to depend upon the kind of last-minute (program)
parameterization implied by (subprogram) parameters to the main
subprogram. POSIX 5 provides a standard operating system command line
interface that might be a more appropriate alternative to the Ada
command line facility depending on the implementation family of an
application.

### Encapsulating Implementation Dependencies

#### guideline

- Create packages specifically designed to isolate hardware and
  implementation dependencies and designed so that their specification
  will not change when porting.
- Clearly indicate the objectives if machine or solution efficiency is
  the reason for hardware or implementation-dependent code.
- For the packages that hide implementation dependencies, maintain
  different package bodies for different target environments.
- Isolate interrupt receiving tasks into implementation-dependent
  packages.
- Refer to Annex M of the Ada Reference Manual (1995) for a list of
  implementation-dependent features.

#### example

See Guideline 7.1.3.

#### rationale

Encapsulating hardware and implementation dependencies in a package
allows the remainder of the code to ignore them and, thus, to be fully
portable. It also localizes the dependencies, making it clear exactly
which parts of the code may need to change when porting the program.

Some implementation-dependent features may be used to achieve particular
performance or efficiency objectives. Commenting these objectives
ensures that the programmer can find an appropriate way to achieve them
when porting to a different implementation or explicitly recognize that
they cannot be achieved.

Interrupt entries are implementation-dependent features that may not be
supported (e.g., VAX Ada uses pragmas to assign system traps to "normal"
rendezvous). However, interrupt entries cannot be avoided in most
embedded, real-time systems, and it is reasonable to assume that they
are supported by an Ada implementation. The value for an interrupt is
implementation-defined. Isolate it.

#### notes

You can use Ada to write machine-dependent programs that take advantage
of an implementation in a manner consistent with the Ada model but that
make particular choices where Ada allows implementation freedom. These
machine dependencies should be treated in the same way as any other
implementation-dependent features of the code.

### Implementation-Added Features

#### guideline

- Avoid the use of vendor-supplied packages.
- Avoid the use of features added to the predefined packages that are
  not specified in the Ada language definition or Specialized Needs
  Annexes.

#### rationale

Vendor-added features are not likely to be provided by other
implementations. Even if a majority of vendors eventually provide
similar additional features, they are unlikely to have identical
formulations. Indeed, different vendors may use the same formulation for
(semantically) entirely different features. See Guideline 7.5.2 for
further information on vendor-supplied exceptions.

Ada has introduced a number of new pragmas and attributes that were not
present in Ada 83 (Ada Reference Manual 1983). These new pragmas and
attributes may clash with implementation-defined pragmas and attributes.

#### exceptions

There are many kinds of applications that require the use of these
features. Examples include multilingual systems that standardize on a
vendor's file system, applications that are closely integrated with
vendor products (i.e., user interfaces), and embedded systems for
performance reasons. Isolate the use of these features into packages.

If a vendor-supplied package is provided in compilable source code form,
use of the package does not make a program nonportable provided that the
package does not contain any nonportable code and can be lawfully
included in your program.

### Specialized Needs Annexes

#### guideline

- Use features defined in the Specialized Needs Annexes rather than
  vendor-defined features.
- Document clearly the use of any features from the Specialized Needs
  Annexes (systems programming, real-time systems, distributed
  systems, information systems, numerics, and safety and security).

#### rationale

The Specialized Needs Annexes define standards for specific application
areas without extending the syntax of the language. You can port a
program with specific domain needs (e.g., distributed systems,
information systems) across vendor implementations more easily if they
support the features standardized in an annex rather than rely on
specific vendor extensions. The purpose of the annexes is to provide a
consistent and uniform way to address issues faced in several
application areas where Ada is expected to be used. Because different
compilers will support different sets of annexes if any, you may have
portability problems if you rely on the features defined in any given
annex.

The Specialized Needs Annexes provide special capabilities that go
beyond the core language definition. Because compilers are not required
to support the special-purpose annexes, you should localize your use of
these features where possible. By documenting their usage, you are
leaving a record of potential porting difficulties for future
programmers.

### Dependence on Parameter Passing Mechanism

#### guideline

- Do not write code whose correct execution depends on the particular
  parameter passing mechanism used by an implementation (Ada Reference
  Manual 1995, ยง6.2; Cohen 1986).
- If a subprogram has more than one formal parameter of a given
  subtype, at least one of which is \[in\] out, make sure that the
  subprogram can properly handle the case when both formal parameters
  denote the same actual object.

#### example

The output of this program depends on the particular parameter passing
mechanism that was used:

```ada
------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Ada.Integer_Text_IO;
procedure Outer is
   type Coordinates is
      record
         X : Integer := 0;
         Y : Integer := 0;
      end record;
   Outer_Point : Coordinates;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   procedure Inner (Inner_Point : in out Coordinates) is
   begin
      Inner_Point.X := 5;
      -- The following line causes the output of the program to
      -- depend on the parameter passing mechanism.
      Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Put(Outer_Point.X);
   end Inner;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
begin  -- Outer
   Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Put(Outer_Point.X);
   Inner(Outer_Point);
   Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Put(Outer_Point.X);
end Outer;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

If the parameter passing mechanism is by copy, the results on the
standard output file are:

0 0 5

If the parameter passing mechanism is by reference, the results are:

0 5 5

The following code fragment shows where there is a potential for bounded
error when a procedure is called with actual parameters denoting the
same object:

```ada
procedure Test_Bounded_Error (Parm_1 : in out    Integer;
                              Parm_2 : in out Integer) is
   procedure Inner (Parm : in out Integer) is
   begin
      Parm := Parm * 10;
   end Inner;
begin
   Parm_2 := 5;
   Inner (Parm_1);
end Test_Bounded_Error;
```

In executing the procedure Test_Bounded_Error, both Parm_1 and
Parm_2 denote the object Actual_Parm. After executing the first
statement, the object Actual_Parm has the value 5. When the procedure
Inner is called, its formal parameter Parm denotes Actual_Parm. It
cannot be determined whether it denotes the old value of Parm_1, in
this case 1, or the new value, in this case 5.

```ada
Actual_Parm : Integer := 1;
...
Test_Bounded_Error (Actual_Parm, Actual_Parm);  -- potential bounded error
```

#### rationale

Certain composite types (untagged records and arrays) can be passed
either by copy or by reference. If there are two or more formal
parameters of the same type, one or more of which is writable, then you
should document whether you assume that these formal parameters do not
denote the same actual object. Similarly, if a subprogram that has a
formal parameter of a given subtype also makes an up-level reference to
an object of this same type, you should document whether you assume that
the formal parameter denotes a different object from the object named in
the up-level reference. In these situations where an object can be
accessed through distinct formal parameter paths, the exception
Program_Error may be raised, the new value may be read, or the old
value of the object may be used (Ada Reference Manual 1995, ยง6.2).

See also Guideline 8.2.7.

#### exceptions

Frequently, when interfacing Ada to foreign code, dependence on
parameter-passing mechanisms used by a particular implementation is
unavoidable. In this case, isolate the calls to the foreign code in an
interface package that exports operations that do not depend on the
parameter-passing mechanism.

### Arbitrary Order Dependencies

#### guideline

- Avoid depending on the order in which certain constructs in Ada are
  evaluated.

#### example

The output of this program depends upon the order of evaluation of
subprogram parameters, but the Ada Reference Manual (1995, ยง6.4)
specifies that these evaluations are done in an arbitrary order:

```ada
package Utilities is
   function Unique_ID return Integer;
end Utilities;

package body Utilities is

   ID : Integer := 0;

   function Unique_ID return Integer is
   begin
      ID := ID + 1;
      return ID;
   end Unique_ID;

end Utilities;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Utilities; use Utilities;
procedure P is
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Integer'Image(Unique_ID) & Integer'Image(Unique_ID));
end P;
```

If the parameters to the "&" function are evaluated in textual order,
the output is:

1 2

If the parameters are evaluated in the reverse order, the output is:

2 1

#### rationale

The Ada language defines certain evaluations to occur in arbitrary order
(e.g., subprogram parameters). While a dependency on the order of
evaluation may not adversely affect the program on a certain
implementation, the code might not execute correctly when it is ported.
For example, if two actual parameters of a subprogram call have side
effects, the effect of the program could depend on the order of
evaluation (Ada Reference Manual 1995, ยง1.1.4). Avoid arbitrary order
dependencies, but also recognize that even an unintentional error of
this kind could prohibit portability.
