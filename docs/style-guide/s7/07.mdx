title: 7.7 Summary

### fundamentals

- In programs or components intended to have a long life, avoid using
  the features of Ada declared as "obsolescent" by Annex J of the Ada
  Reference Manual (1995), unless the use of the feature is needed for
  backward compatibility with Ada 83 (Ada Reference Manual 1983).
- Document the use of any obsolescent features.
- Avoid using the following features:
  - The short renamings of the packages in the predefined
    environment (e.g., Text_IO as opposed to Ada.Text_IO)
  - The character replacements of \! for |, : for \#, and % for
    quotation marks
  - Reduced accuracy subtypes of floating-point types
  - The 'Constrained attribute as applied to private types
  - The predefined package ASCII
  - The exception Numeric_Error
  - Various representation specifications, including at clauses, mod
    clauses, interrupt entries, and the Storage_Size attribute
- Make informed assumptions about the support provided for the
  following on potential target platforms:
  - Number of bits available for type Integer (range constraints)
  - Number of decimal digits of precision available for
    floating-point types
  - Number of bits available for fixed-point types (delta and range
    constraints)
  - Number of characters per line of source text
  - Number of bits for Root_Integer expressions
  - Number of seconds for the range of Duration
  - Number of milliseconds for Duration'Small
  - Minimum and maximum scale for decimal types
- Avoid assumptions about the values and the number of values included
  in the type Character.
- Use highlighting comments for each package, subprogram, and task
  where any nonportable features are present.
- For each nonportable feature employed, describe the expectations for
  that feature.
- Consider using only a parameterless procedure as the main
  subprogram.
- Consider using Ada.Command_Line for accessing values from the
  environment, but recognize that this package's behavior and even its
  specification are nonportable.
- Encapsulate and document all uses of package Ada.Command_Line.
- Create packages specifically designed to isolate hardware and
  implementation dependencies and designed so that their specification
  will not change when porting.
- Clearly indicate the objectives if machine or solution efficiency is
  the reason for hardware or implementation-dependent code.
- For the packages that hide implementation dependencies, maintain
  different package bodies for different target environments.
- Isolate interrupt receiving tasks into implementation-dependent
  packages.
- Refer to Annex M of the Ada Reference Manual (1995) for a list of
  implementation-dependent features.
- Avoid the use of vendor-supplied packages.
- Avoid the use of features added to the predefined packages that are
  not specified in the Ada language definition or Specialized Needs
  Annexes.
- Use features defined in the Specialized Needs Annexes rather than
  vendor-defined features.
- Document clearly the use of any features from the Specialized Needs
  Annexes (systems programming, real-time systems, distributed
  systems, information systems, numerics, and safety and security).
- Do not write code whose correct execution depends on the particular
  parameter passing mechanism used by an implementation (Ada Reference
  Manual 1995, ยง6.2; Cohen 1986).
- If a subprogram has more than one formal parameter of a given
  subtype, at least one of which is \[in\] out, make sure that the
  subprogram can properly handle the case when both formal parameters
  denote the same actual object.
- Avoid depending on the order in which certain constructs in Ada are
  evaluated .

### numeric types and expressions

- Avoid using the predefined numeric types in package Standard . Use
  range and digits declarations and let the implementation pick the
  appropriate representation.
- For programs that require greater accuracy than that provided by the
  global assumptions, define a package that declares a private type
  and operations as needed; see Pappas (1985) for a full explanation
  and examples.
- Consider using predefined numeric types (Integer, Natural, Positive)
  for:
  - Indexes into arrays where the index type is not significant,
    such as type String
  - "Pure" numbers, that is, numbers with no associated physical
    unit (e.g., exponents)
  - Values whose purpose is to control a repeat or iteration count
- Use an implementation that supports the Numerics Annex (Ada
  Reference Manual 1995, Annex G) when performance and accuracy are
  overriding concerns .
- Carefully analyze what accuracy and precision you really need.
- Do not press the accuracy limits of the machine(s).
- Comment the analysis and derivation of the numerical aspects of a
  program.
- Anticipate the range of values of subexpressions to avoid exceeding
  the underlying range of their base type. Use derived types,
  subtypes, factoring, and range constraints on numeric types.
- Consider using \<= and \>= to do relational tests on real valued
  arguments, avoiding the \<, \>, =, and /= operations.
- Use values of type attributes in comparisons and checking for small
  values.
- In information systems, declare different numeric decimal types to
  correspond to different scales (Brosgol, Eachus, and Emery 1994).
- Create objects of different decimal types to reflect different units
  of measure (Brosgol, Eachus, and Emery 1994).
- Declare subtypes of the appropriately scaled decimal type to provide
  appropriate range constraints for application-specific types.
- Encapsulate each measure category in a package (Brosgol, Eachus, and
  Emery 1994).
- Declare as few decimal types as possible for unitless data (Brosgol,
  Eachus, and Emery 1994).
- For decimal calculations, determine whether the result should be
  truncated toward 0 or rounded.
- Avoid decimal types and arithmetic on compilers that do not support
  the Information Systems Annex (Ada Reference Manual 1995, Annex F)
  in full.

### storage control

- Do not use a representation clause to specify number of storage
  units.
- Do not compare access-to-subprogram values.
- Consider using explicitly defined storage pool mechanisms.

### tasking

- Do not depend on the order in which task objects are activated when
  declared in the same declarative list.
- Do not depend on a particular delay being achievable (Nissen and
  Wallis 1984).
- Never use knowledge of the execution pattern of tasks to achieve
  timing requirements.
- Do not assume a correlation between System.Tick and type Duration.
- Do not depend on the order in which guard conditions are evaluated
  or on the algorithm for choosing among several open select
  alternatives.
- Do not assume that tasks execute uninterrupted until they reach a
  synchronization point.
- Use pragma Priority to distinguish general levels of importance
  only.
- Avoid using the abort statement.
- Do not use unprotected shared variables.
- Consider using protected types to provide data synchronization.
- Have tasks communicate through the rendezvous mechanism.
- Do not use unprotected shared variables as a task synchronization
  device.
- Consider using protected objects to encapsulate shared data.
- Use pragma Atomic or Volatile only when you are forced to by
  run-time system deficiencies.

#### exceptions

- Do not depend on the exact locations at which predefined exceptions
  are raised.
- Do not rely on the behavior of Ada.Exceptions beyond the minimum
  defined in the language.
- Do not raise implementation-specific exceptions.
- Convert implementation-specific exceptions within interface packages
  to visible user-defined exceptions.

### representation clauses and implementation-dependent features

- Use algorithms that do not depend on the representation of the data
  and, therefore, do not need representation clauses.
- Consider using representation clauses when accessing or defining
  interface data or when a specific representation is needed to
  implement a design .
- Do not assume that sharing source files between programs guarantees
  the same representation of data types in those files.
- Avoid using package System constants except in attempting to
  generalize other machine-dependent constructs.
- Avoid machine code inserts.
- Use the package Interfaces and its language-defined child packages
  rather than implementation-specific mechanisms.
- Consider using pragma Import rather than access-to-subprogram types
  for interfacing to subprograms in other languages.
- Isolate all subprograms employing pragmas Import, Export, and
  Convention to implementation-specific (interface) package bodies.
- Avoid pragmas and attributes added by the compiler implementor.
- Avoid dependence on Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation.
- Avoid dependence on the attribute Unchecked_Access.
- Avoid dependence on Ada.Unchecked_Conversion.
- Avoid the direct invocation of or implicit dependence upon an
  underlying host operating system or Ada run-time support system,
  except where the interface is explicitly defined in the language
  (e.g., Annex C or D of the Ada Reference Manual \[1995\]).
- Use standard bindings and the package Ada.Command_Line when you
  need to invoke the underlying

run-time support system.

- Use features defined in the Annexes rather than vendor-defined
  features.

### input/output

- Use constants and variables as symbolic actuals for the Name and
  Form parameters on the predefined I/O packages. Declare and
  initialize them in an implementation dependency package.
- Close all files explicitly.
- Avoid performing I/O on access types.
- Consider using Sequential_IO or Direct_IO instead of Stream_IO
  unless you need the low-level, heterogeneous I/O features provided
  by Stream_IO.
- Consider using Current_Error and Set_Error for run-time error
  messages.
