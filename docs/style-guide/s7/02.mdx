title: 7.2 Numeric Types and Expressions
---

A great deal of care was taken with the design of the Ada features
related to numeric computations to ensure that the language could be
used in embedded systems and mathematical applications where precision
was important. As far as possible, these features were made portable.
However, there is an inevitable tradeoff between maximally exploiting
the available precision of numeric computation on a particular machine
and maximizing the portability of Ada numeric constructs. This means
that these Ada features, particularly numeric types and expressions,
must be used with great care if full portability of the resulting
program is to be guaranteed.

### Predefined Numeric Types

#### guideline

- Avoid using the predefined numeric types in package Standard. Use
  range and digits declarations and let the implementation pick the
  appropriate representation.
- For programs that require greater accuracy than that provided by the
  global assumptions, define a package that declares a private type
  and operations as needed; see Pappas (1985) for a full explanation
  and examples.
- Consider using predefined numeric types (Integer, Natural, Positive)
  for:
  - Indexes into arrays where the index type is not significant,
    such as type String
  - "Pure" numbers, that is, numbers with no associated physical
    unit (e.g., exponents)
  - Values whose purpose is to control a repeat or iteration count

#### example

The second and third examples below are not representable as subranges
of Integer on a machine with a 16-bit word. The first example below
allows a compiler to choose a multiword representation, if necessary.

Use:

```ada
type    Second_Of_Day is             range 0 .. 86_400;
```

rather than:

```ada
type    Second_Of_Day is new Integer range 1 .. 86_400;
```

or:

```ada
subtype Second_Of_Day is     Integer range 1 .. 86_400;
```

#### rationale

An implementor is free to define the range of the predefined numeric
types. Porting code from an implementation with greater accuracy to one
of lesser accuracy is a time consuming and error-prone process. Many of
the errors are not reported until run-time.

This applies to more than just numerical computation. An
easy-to-overlook instance of this problem occurs if you neglect to use
explicitly declared types for integer discrete ranges (array sizes, loop
ranges, etc.) (see Guidelines 5.5.1 and 5.5.2). If you do not provide an
explicit type when specifying index constraints and other discrete
ranges, a predefined integer type is assumed.

The predefined numeric types are useful when you use them wisely. You
should not use them to avoid declaring numeric types—then you lose the
benefits of strong typing. When your application deals with different
kinds of quantities and units, you should definitely separate them
through the use of distinct numeric types. However, if you are simply
counting the number of iterations in an iterative approximation
algorithm, declaring a special integer type is probably overkill. The
predefined exponentiation operators \*\* require an integer as the type
of its right operand.

You should use the predefined types Natural and Positive for
manipulating certain kinds of values in the predefined language
environment. The types String and Wide_String use an index of type
Positive. If your code indexes into a string using an incompatible
integer type, you will be forced to do type conversion, reducing its
readability. If you are performing operations like slices and
concatenation, the subtype of your numeric array index is probably
insignificant and you are better off using a predefined subtype. On the
other hand, if your array represents a table (e.g., a hash table), then
your index subtype is significant, and you should declare a distinct
index type.

#### notes

There is an alternative that this guideline permits. As Guideline 7.1.5
suggests, implementation dependencies can be encapsulated in packages
intended for that purpose. This could include the definition of a 32-bit
integer type. It would then be possible to derive additional types from
that 32-bit type.

### Accuracy Model

#### guideline

- Use an implementation that supports the Numerics Annex (Ada
  Reference Manual 1995, Annex G) when performance and accuracy are
  overriding concerns.

#### rationale

The Numerics Annex defines the accuracy and performance requirements for
floating- and fixed-point arithmetic. The Annex provides a "strict" mode
in which the compiler must support these requirements. To guarantee that
your program's numerical performance is portable, you should compile and
link in the strict mode. If your program relies upon the numeric
properties of the strict mode, then it will only be portable to other
environments that support the strict numerics mode.

The accuracy of floating-point numbers is based on what machine numbers
can be represented exactly in storage. A computational result in a
register can fall between two machine numbers when the register contains
more bits than storage. You can step through the machine numbers using
the attributes 'Pred and 'Succ. Other attributes return values of the
mantissa, exponent, radix, and other characteristics of floating- and
fixed-point numbers.

### Accuracy Analysis

#### guideline

- Carefully analyze what accuracy and precision you really need.

#### rationale

Floating-point calculations are done with the equivalent of the
implementation's predefined floating-point types. The effect of extra
"guard" digits in internal computations can sometimes lower the number
of digits that must be specified in an Ada declaration. This may not be
consistent over implementations where the program is intended to be run.
It may also lead to the false conclusion that the declared types are
sufficient for the accuracy required.

You should choose the numeric type declarations to satisfy the lowest
precision (smallest number of digits) that will provide the required
accuracy. Careful analysis will be necessary to show that the
declarations are adequate. When you move to a machine with less
precision, you probably can use the same type declaration.

### Accuracy Constraints

#### guideline

- Do not press the accuracy limits of the machine(s).

#### rationale

Just because two different machines use the same number of digits in the
mantissa of a floating-point number does not imply they will have the
same arithmetic properties. Some Ada implementations may give slightly
better accuracy than required by Ada because they make efficient use of
the machine. Do not write programs that depend on this.

### Comments

#### guideline

- Comment the analysis and derivation of the numerical aspects of a
  program.

#### rationale

Decisions and background about why certain precisions are required in a
program are important to program revision or porting. The underlying
numerical analysis leading to the program should be commented.

### Subexpression Evaluation

#### guideline

- Anticipate the range of values of subexpressions to avoid exceeding
  the underlying range of their base type. Use derived types,
  subtypes, factoring, and range constraints on numeric types (see
  Guidelines 3.4.1, 5.3.1, and 5.5.3).

#### example

This example is adapted from the Rationale (1995, §3.3):

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Integer_Text_IO;
procedure Demo_Overflow is
-- assume the predefined type Integer has a 16-bit range
   X : Integer := 24_000;
   Y : Integer;
begin  -- Demo_Overflow
   y := (3 * X) / 4;  -- raises Constraint_Error if the machine registers used are 16-bit
  -- mathematically correct intermediate result if 32-bit registers
   Ada.Text_IO.Put ("(");
   Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Put (X);
   Ada.Text_IO.Put (" * 3 ) / 4 = ");
   Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Put (Y);
exception
   when Constraint_Error =>
      Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("3 * X too big for register!");
end Demo_Overflow;
```

#### rationale

The Ada language does not require that an implementation perform range
checks on subexpressions within an expression. Ada does require that
overflow checks be performed. Thus, depending on the order of evaluation
and the size of the registers, a subexpression will either overflow or
produce the mathematically correct result. In the event of an overflow,
you will get the exception Constraint_Error. Even if the implementation
on your program's current target does not result in an overflow on a
subexpression evaluation, your program might be ported to an
implementation that does.

### Relational Tests

#### guideline

- Consider using \<= and \>= to do relational tests on real valued
  arguments, avoiding the \<, \>, =, and /= operations.
- Use values of type attributes in comparisons and checking for small
  values.

#### example

The following examples test for (1) absolute "equality" in storage, (2)
absolute "equality" in computation, (3) relative "equality" in storage,
and (4) relative "equality" in computation:

```ada
abs (X - Y) <= Float_Type'Model_Small                -- (1)
abs (X - Y) <= Float_Type'Base'Model_Small           -- (2)
abs (X - Y) <= abs X * Float_Type'Model_Epsilon      -- (3)
abs (X - Y) <= abs X * Float_Type'Base'Model_Epsilon -- (4)
```

And, specifically, for "equality" to 0:

```ada
abs X <= Float_Type'Model_Small                      -- (1)
abs X <= Float_Type'Base'Model_Small                 -- (2)
abs X <= abs X * Float_Type'Model_Epsilon            -- (3)
abs X <= abs X * Float_Type'Base'Model_Epsilon       -- (4)
```

#### rationale

Strict relational comparisons ( \<, \>, =, /= ) are a general problem
with computations involving real numbers. Because of the way comparisons
are defined in terms of model intervals, it is possible for the values
of the comparisons to depend on the implementation. Within a model
interval, the result of comparing two values is nondeterministic if the
values are not model numbers. In general, you should test for proximity
rather than equality as shown in the examples. See also Rationale (1995,
§§G.4.1 and G.4.2.).

Type attributes are the primary means of symbolically accessing the
implementation of the Ada numeric model. When the characteristics of the
model numbers are accessed by type attributes, the source code is
portable. The appropriate model numbers of any implementation will then
be used by the generated code.

Although 0 is technically not a special case, it is often overlooked
because it looks like the simplest and, therefore, safest case. But in
reality, each time comparisons involve small values, you should evaluate
the situation to determine which technique is appropriate.

#### notes

Regardless of language, real-valued computations have inaccuracy. That
the corresponding mathematical operations have algebraic properties
usually introduces some confusion. This guideline explains how Ada deals
with the problem that most languages face.

### Decimal Types and the Information Systems Annex

#### guideline

- In information systems, declare different numeric decimal types to
  correspond to different scales (Brosgol, Eachus, and Emery 1994).
- Create objects of different decimal types to reflect different units
  of measure (Brosgol, Eachus, and Emery 1994).
- Declare subtypes of the appropriately scaled decimal type to provide
  appropriate range constraints for application-specific types.
- Encapsulate each measure category in a package (Brosgol, Eachus, and
  Emery 1994).
- Declare as few decimal types as possible for unitless data (Brosgol,
  Eachus, and Emery 1994).
- For decimal calculations, determine whether the result should be
  truncated toward 0 or rounded.
- Avoid decimal types and arithmetic on compilers that do not support
  the Information Systems Annex (Ada Reference Manual 1995, Annex F)
  in full.

#### example

```ada
-- The salary cap today is $500,000; however this can be expanded to $99,999,999.99.
type Executive_Salary is delta 0.01 digits 10 range 0 .. 500_000.00;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
package Currency is

   type Dollars is delta 0.01 digits 12;

   type Marks   is delta 0.01 digits 12;

   type Yen     is delta 0.01 digits 12;

   function To_Dollars (M : Marks) return Dollars;
   function To_Dollars (Y : Yen)   return Dollars;

   function To_Marks (D : Dollars) return Marks;
   function To_Marks (Y : Yen)     return Marks;

   function To_Yen (D : Dollars) return Yen;
   function To_Yen (M : Marks)   return Yen;

end Currency;
```

#### rationale

The Ada language does not provide any predefined decimal types.
Therefore, you need to declare decimal types for the different scales
you will need to use. Differences in scale and precision must be
considered in deciding whether or not a common type will suffice
(Brosgol, Eachus, and Emery 1994).

You need different types for objects measured in different units. This
allows the compiler to detect mismatched values in expressions. If you
declare all decimal objects to be of a single type, you forego the
benefits of strong typing. For example, in an application that involves
several currencies, each currency should be declared as a separate type.
You should provide appropriate conversions between different currencies.

You should map data with no particular unit of measure to a small set of
types or a single type to avoid the explosion of conversions between
numeric types.

Separate the range requirement on a decimal type from its precision,
i.e., the number of significant digits required. From the point of view
of planning for change and ease of maintenance, you can use the digit's
value to accommodate future growth in the values to be stored in objects
of the type. For example, you may want to anticipate growth for database
values and report formats. You can constrain the values of the type
through a range constraint that matches current needs. It is easier to
modify the range and avoid redefining databases and reports.

Ada automatically truncates toward 0. If your requirements are to round
the decimal result, you must explicitly do so using the 'Round
attribute.

The core language defines the basic syntax of and operations on decimal
types. It does not specify, however, the minimum number of significant
digits that must be supported. Nor does the core language require the
compiler to support values of Small other than powers of 2, thus
enabling the compiler effectively to reject a decimal declaration (Ada
Reference Manual 1995, §3.5.9). The Information Systems Annex provides
additional support for decimal types. It requires a minimum of 18
significant digits. It also specifies a Text_IO.Editing package that
provides support analogous to the COBOL picture approach.

### Storage Control

The management of dynamic storage can vary between Ada environments. In
fact, some environments do not provide any deallocation. The following
Ada storage control mechanisms are implementation-dependent and should
be used with care in writing portable programs.

### Representation Clause

#### guideline

- Do not use a representation clause to specify number of storage
  units.

#### rationale

The meaning of the 'Storage_Size attribute is ambiguous; specifying a
particular value will not improve portability. It may or may not include
space allocated for parameters, data, etc. Save the use of this feature
for designs that must depend on a particular vendor's implementation.

#### notes

During a porting activity, it can be assumed that any occurrence of
storage specification indicates an implementation dependency that must
be redesigned.

### Access-to-Subprogram Values

#### guideline

- Do not compare access-to-subprogram values.

#### rationale

The Ada Reference Manual (1995, §3.10.2) explains that an
"implementation may consider two access-to-subprogram values to be
unequal, even though they designate the same subprogram. This might be
because one points directly to the subprogram, while the other points to
a special prologue that performs an Elaboration_Check and then jumps to
the subprogram." The Ada Reference Manual (1995, §4.5.2) states that it
is "unspecified whether two access values that designate the same
subprogram but are the result of distinct evaluations of Access
attribute references are equal or unequal."

See also Guideline 5.3.4.

#### exceptions

If you must compare an access-to-subprogram value, you should define a
constant using the access-to-subprogram value and make all future
comparisons against the constant. However, if you attempt to compare
access-to-subprogram values with different levels of indirection, the
values might still be unequal, even if designating the same subprogram.

### Storage Pool Mechanisms

#### guideline

- Consider using explicitly defined storage pool mechanisms.

#### example

See the Ada Reference Manual 1995, §13.11.2).

You use allocators as before. Instead of using unchecked deallocation,
you maintain your own free lists of objects that are no longer in use
and available for reuse.

You use allocators and possibly unchecked deallocation; however, you
implement a storage pool and associate it with the access type(s) via a
Storage_Pool clause. You can use this technique to implement a
mark/release storage management paradigm, which might be significantly
faster than an allocate/deallocate paradigm. Some vendors may provide a
mark/release package as part of their Ada environment.

You do not use allocators, but instead use unchecked conversion from the
address and do all your own default initialization, etc. It is unlikely
you would use this last option because you lose automatic default
initialization.
