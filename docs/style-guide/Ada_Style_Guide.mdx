## Preface

This [style guide](w:Programming_style "wikilink") is an update to the
_[Ada 95 Quality and Style
Guide](http://www.adaic.org/docs/95style/html/cover.html)_ to reflect
the latest update to the [Ada
language](<w:Ada_(programming_language)> "wikilink"), commonly called
Ada 2012. The purpose of this
guide is to help computer professionals produce better Ada programs by
identifying a set of stylistic guidelines that will directly impact the
quality of their Ada programs. This style guide is not intended to
replace the _[Ada Reference
Manual](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/ada12.html)_, or the
_[Rationale](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rationale12.html)_, or to
serve as a tutorial for the Ada programming.

The style guide is divided into chapters that map to the major decisions
that each programmer addresses when creating high-quality, reliable,
reusable, and portable Ada software. Some overlap exists in the chapters
because not all programming decisions can be made independently.
Individual chapters address source code presentation, readability,
program structure, programming practice, concurrency, portability,
reusability, performance, and a new chapter on object-oriented features.

Each chapter is divided into guidelines, using a format that supports
wide usage because its content is both prescriptive and tailorable. Each
guideline consists of a concise statement of the principles that should
be followed and a rationale explaining why the guideline is important.
The guidelines also provide usage examples, in addition to possible
exceptions to applying the guidelines. Many of the guidelines are
specific enough to be adopted as corporate or project programming
standards. Others require a managerial decision on a particular
instantiation before they can be used as standards. In such cases, a
sample instantiation is presented and used throughout the examples.

### Background

The Ada Joint Program Office (AJPO) funded the Ada 95 style guide, which
was created by merging a set of guidelines for using Ada
95 with modifications to the
original _[Ada Quality and Style: Guidelines for Professional
Programmers](http://archive.adaic.com/docs/style-guide/83style/html/)_,
version 02.01.01 (AQ\&S 83) (Software Productivity Consortium 1992),
developed to support Ada 83. The
Ada 95 guidelines are based on the wealth of data available from the Ada
9X Project, the AJPO library, and the Ada community at large. The
Software Productivity Consortium's (Consortium's) technical staff
authored the update and the [Advanced Research Projects
Agency](w:Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency "wikilink") (ARPA)
participated in the update effort.

The preexisting AQ\&S 83 presented a set of guidelines to help the
programmer make disciplined use of Ada's features. In 1992, the
Consortium completed the version 2.1 update to the style guide under
contract to the AJPO. The AJPO referred to that style guide as "the
suggested style guide for all DoD programs."

As yet, there is no formal update of the style guide for the Ada 2005 or
the Ada 2012 language revision. During an extended discussion at the
[SIGAda 2008](http://www.sigada.org/conf/sigada2008/) conference of the
style guide via-a-vis the Ada 2005 update and its continuing relevance,
several attendees volunteered to bring the guide to
wikibooks to encourage collaborative updating of
the guide by putting the update in the hands of practitioners of the
language. This is in part made possible under the terms of the DoD Ada
Joint Program Office's royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license for unlimited use of the material in the Ada 83 and
95 style guides.
