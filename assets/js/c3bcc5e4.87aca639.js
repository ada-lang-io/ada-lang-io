Where paragraphs are inserted, the paragraph numbers are of the form pp.nn, where pp is the number of the preceding paragraph, and nn is an insertion number. For instance, the first paragraph inserted after paragraph 8 is numbered 8.1, the second paragraph inserted is numbered 8.2, and so on. Deleted paragraphs are indicated by text such as ",(0,r.jsx)("em",{children:"This paragraph was deleted."})," Deleted paragraphs include empty paragraphs that were numbered in the 1995 edition of the Ada Reference Manual. Similar markings and numbering are used for changes to annotations.

For non-normative text such as NOTES and Examples, paragraph numbers of unchanged context may change without indication. This may happen if additional normative content is added to a subclause.
