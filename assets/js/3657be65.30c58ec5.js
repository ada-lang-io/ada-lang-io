However, Ada 2005 requires at least part of the tags to be dynamically constructed for a type derived from a type at a shallower level. For dynamically constructed tags, detecting the error can be expensive and unreliable. To see this, consider a program containing two tasks. Task A creates a nested tagged type, passes the tag to task B (which saves it), and then terminates. The nested tag (if dynamic) probably will need to refer in some way to the stack frame for task A. If task B later tries to use the tag created by task A, the tag's reference to the stack frame of A probably is a dangling pointer. Avoiding this would require some sort of protected tag manager, which would be a bottleneck in a program's performance. Moreover, we'd still have a race condition; if task A terminated after the tag check, but before the tag was used, we'd still have a problem. That means that all of these operations would have to be serialized. That could be a significant performance drain, whether or not nested tagged types are ever used.
