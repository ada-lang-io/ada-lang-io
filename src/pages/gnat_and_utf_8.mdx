# Using UTF-8 encoding in GNAT

Nowadays UTF-8 is de facto standard for source code representation.
So a newbie Ada developer could expect this as default for GNAT tools, but it's not.
Let's see how things actually turn out.

Although the 
[Ada language Standard](https://ada-lang.io/docs/arm/AA-2/AA-2.1#implementation-requirements)
says that the compiler must understand texts in UTF-8 encoding:

> An Ada implementation shall accept Ada source code in UTF-8 encoding, with
> or without a BOM (see A.4.11), where every character is represented by its
> code point.

But this does not mean that the compiler must do so "by default".
The GNAT compiler does not violate the standard, but it does not accept the
UTF-8 encoding by default.
The same applies to the rest of the GNAT tools.

## GNAT Studio

After installing the compiler and GNAT Studio development environment,
the newbie developer will write the first program:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Main is
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Привет");
end Main;
```

But he won't be able to build this program, or even save it.
GNAT Studio will complain:

> This buffer contains UTF-8 characters which could not be translated to ISO-8859-1.
>
> Some data may be missing in the saved file: check the Locations View.
>
> You may change the character set of this file through the "Properties..." contextual menu.

And "Locations View" shows details:

> Error converting from UTF8 to ISO-8859-1
>
> main.adb:5:1: Invalid byte sequence in conversion input

You can change encoding for this file using "Properties..." contextual menu, but
for the next file it will be the same.

Instead, it is better to change the default encoding. Go to the settings
"/Edit/Preferences...", "General" and change "Character set" to
"Unicode UTF-8". Re-create the file "main.adb" and it will save
successfully.

## Compiler

Now you can build the program and it will even work as expected
(but only if you have the console in UTF-8; on Windows you can switch the
`cmd.exe` console to UTF-8 using the command `chcp 65001`).
But from the compiler point of view the string "Hello" will be 12(!)
characters long.
The point is that according to the Standard
([ARM 3.5.2 2/3](https://ada-lang.io/docs/arm/AA-3/AA-3.5#352--character-types))
the `Character` type includes only 256 values from the Latin-1 set:

> The predefined type Character is a character type whose values correspond
> to the 256 code points of Row 00 (also known as Latin-1) of the
> ISO/IEC 10646:2017 Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).

So, it does not contain any Cyrillic character.
The compiler does not know that you have set the default encoding in the IDE
to UTF-8. It still uses its default encoding. As 
[GNAT User guide](https://docs.adacore.com/gnat_ugn-docs/html/gnat_ugn/gnat_ugn/the_gnat_compilation_model.html#source-representation)
states:

> Ada source programs are represented in standard text files, using Latin-1 coding.

The compiler sees this program as

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Main is
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Ð_Ñ_Ð¸Ð²ÐµÑ_");
end Main;
```

 here `_` indicates non-printable characters in Latin-1.

:::note To be investigated
 
 Shouldn't the compiler rise compilation error on
 non-printable characters in a sting literal??
 
:::

You can tell the compiler the encoding of the input texts by passing
the `-gnatW8` option. Hre is the described in the options list
(`gnatmake --help`):

```text
    -gnatW?   Wide character encoding method (?=h/u/s/e/8/b)
```

The simplest way to specify this option is to change the project properties
by selecting the menu "/Edit/Project Properties...", the tab 
"/Build/Switches/Ada" and write `-gnatW8` in the options bar at the bottom
of the form.

The project file `default.gpr` will look like this:

```
project Default is

   for Source_Dirs use ("src");
   for Object_Dir use "obj";
   for Main use ("main.adb");

   package Compiler is
      for Switches ("ada") use ("-gnatW8");
   end Compiler;

end Default;
```

Now the compiler will see the Cyrillic alphabet and refuse to build
the program:

```
Builder results
  /tmp/utf8/src/main.adb
    5:27 error: literal out of range of type Standard.Character
```

And it is right. We need a different type of string here. Yes, there are
several types of strings in Ada. There are even too many of them. And not
one is good enough for all cases of real life. From the Ada string types
you can trace how string encodings evolved. Before the first version of 
the language, only 127 characters of the ASCII set could fit into
`Character`. But this was quickly corrected by expanding `Character`
to 256 Latin-1 values. The next version of the standard, around the 
time of Java appearance, where the character size was 16 bits,
introduced `Wide_Character`, which contains 65536 characters, and
it seemed to be enough for everyone. But Unicode came along, with
a repertoire of 1,114,112 "code points". Then `Wide_Wide_Character`
with 32 bits and 2 billion characters was introduced. 
Note that the "old" types `Character`/`String`, `Wide_Character`/`Wide_String`
were not depricated at all. Moreover, `String` is widely used in the standard
library! For example, in I/O file names, in `Ada.Environments`, and so on.
It's a slippery place where you can make a lot of mistakes.
But that's not what we are talking about yet.

Let's replace `String` with `Wide_String`? Easy! But we also need another package
instead of `Text_IO`:

```ada
with Ada.Wide_Text_IO;

procedure Main is
begin
   Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Put_Line ("Привет");
end Main;
```

To emphasize the differences, let's rewrite it this way

```ada
with Ada.Wide_Text_IO;

procedure Main is
   Hello : constant Wide_String := "Привет";
begin
   Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Put_Line (Hello);
end Main;
```

Now it works!

## Non-ASCII identifiers

Another compiler option, `-gnatiw`, changes the way the compiler
considers identifiers in a program. The 
[GNAT User's Guide](https://docs.adacore.com/gnat_ugn-docs/html/gnat_ugn/gnat_ugn/building_executable_programs_with_gnat.html#character-set-control)
 ays:

> Normally GNAT recognizes the Latin-1 character set in source program
> identifiers, as described in the Ada Reference Manual. This switch causes
> GNAT to recognize alternate character sets in identifiers.

The guide is oupdated here, since current Ada Standards defines the
*identifier* lexical element in terms Unicode terms, not in Latin-1
characters at all.
That is, the standard allows the use of non-Latin-1 characters in identifiers.
To make the compiler follow the standard, you need to tell it the `-gnatiw`
options (besides `-gnatW8`):

```ada
with Ada.Wide_Text_IO;

procedure Main is
   Привет : constant Wide_String := "Привет";
begin
   Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Put_Line (Привет);
end Main;
```

The use of such names is not particularly encouraged, but I found them very
handy when I tried to write a type system for analyzing Russian morphology.
My knowledge of English ends with the terms "noun" and "verb," so the 
following text is more acceptable to me than in Latin:

```ada
package Ru is
   type Часть_Речи is  --  Part of speech in Russian
     (Существительное,
      Глагол,
      Прилагательное,
      Числительное,
      Наречие,
      Предлог,
      Союз,
      Частица,
      Междометие
     );

   type Лицо is ('1', '2', '3');  --  Grammatical person
   type Время is (Прошедшее, Настоящее, Будущее);  --  Tense
   type Hаклонение is
    (Обычное, Повелительное, Сослогательное);  --  mood
   type Число is (Единственное, Множественное);
   type Род is (Общий, Мужской, Женский, Средний);  --  gender
   type Падеж is   --  case
     (Именительный,
      Родительный,
      Дательный,
      Винительный,
      Творительный,
      Предложный);
```

:::note Advice

Keep compilation units and file names in ASCII to avoid
problems with the compiler and tools.

## When `-gnatW8` isn't allowed

Some style guides prohibit the use of non-ASCII characters
in source code. Does it mean you need not `-gnatW8`?
Let's try to remove `-gnatW8` and see how it works.
We evaluate `Привет` word:

```ada
with Ada.Wide_Text_IO;

procedure Main is
   Hello : constant Wide_String :=
     Wide_Character'Val (1055) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1088) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1080) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1074) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1077) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1090);
begin
   Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Put_Line (Hello);
end Main;
```

The result is, well, non-obvious:

```text
["041F"]["0440"]["0438"]["0432"]["0435"]["0442"]
```

What is it? This is the so-called "Brackets encoding" invented by the GNAT
authors in the early days of `Wide_Character`/`Wide_String`. Let's take
a look at the `Ada.Numerics` package.
Until recently, it looked like this

```ada
package Ada.Numerics is
   pragma Pure;

   Argument_Error : exception;

   Pi : constant :=
          3.14159_26535_89793_23846_26433_83279_50288_41971_69399_37511;

   ["03C0"] : constant := Pi;
   --  This is the Greek letter Pi (for Ada 2005 AI-388). Note that it is
   --  conforming to have this constant present even in Ada 95 mode, as there
   --  is no way for a normal mode Ada 95 program to reference this identifier.
```

In the Standard it is
[defined as](https://ada-lang.io/docs/arm/AA-A/AA-A.5#static-semantics):

```ada
package Ada.Numerics is
   pragma Pure(Numerics);
   Argument_Error : exception;
   Pi : constant :=
          3.14159_26535_89793_23846_26433_83279_50288_41971_69399_37511;
   π  : constant := Pi;
   e  : constant :=
          2.71828_18284_59045_23536_02874_71352_66249_77572_47093_69996;
end Ada.Numerics;
```

Recent versions of the compiler have removed this constant altogether!

```
   --  ???This is removed for now, because nobody uses it, and it causes
   --  trouble for tools other than the compiler. If people want to use the
   --  Greek letter in their programs, they can easily define it themselves.
```

You can make the compiler use UTF-8 even in this case by passing the `-W8`
option to the `gnatbind` stage (in GNAT Studio go to "/Build/Switches/Binder"
tab):

```
project Default is

   for Source_Dirs use ("src");
   for Object_Dir use "obj";
   for Main use ("main.adb");

   package Binder is
      for Switches ("ada") use ("-W8");
   end Binder;

end Default;
```

Another way is to do this while opening a file with the parameter 
`Form => "WCEM=8"`:

```ada
with Ada.Wide_Text_IO;

procedure Main is
   Hello : constant Wide_String :=
     Wide_Character'Val (1055) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1088) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1080) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1074) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1077) &
     Wide_Character'Val (1090);
   Output : Ada.Wide_Text_IO.File_Type;
begin
   Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Create (Output, Name => "aaa.txt", Form => "WCEM=8");
   Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Put_Line (Output, Hello);
end Main;
```

When you use `-gnatW8`, the `gnatbind` `-W8` switch is used automatically.
But you can specify both of them, it won't hurt.

## Other GNAT tools

Using other GNAT programs, look for their encoding flags:

* `gnatpp` `--wide-character-encoding=8`
* `gnatstub` `--wide-character-encoding=8`

Alas, even the 
[Ada Language Server](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server/)
(part of the Ada extension for VS Code) uses `iso-8859-1` by default.
Fix this in the settings via the 
[parameter](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server/blob/master/doc/settings.md#defaultCharset)

    'defaultCharset': 'UTF-8'

## Environment variables

Do not expect your program to pay attention to locale settings (like `LANG`), 
but watch out for environment variables 
`GNAT_CCS_ENCODING`, `GNAT_CODE_PAGE` on Windows.

## Matreshka and VSS Libraries

For some time, the Ada standard was unambiguous in that `Character`/`String`
could only contain Latin-1 characters. But at some point it faltered under 
the onslaught of "lovers of simple solutions" and there appeared functions
to convert `Wide_String`/`Wide_Wide_String` to UTF-8, which use `String`
type instead of an array of bytes to represent UTF-8.

The GNAT authors take full advantage of this, allowing, for example, to pass
to `Ada.Text_IO.Create` the file name in UTF-8 encoding via a parameter of
type `String`.

Introducing the `Wide_Wide_String` type does not really solve the problem of
using Unicode, since this standard does not manipulate "characters", but
combinations of characters. There are variants where several "code points"
form a single glyph when printed/displayed. It is often more convenient for
the user to work in such concepts. This is logical for specifying the 
"line/column" position in the text. `Wide_Wide_String` does not help here.

The 
[VSS library](https://github.com/AdaCore/VSS)
introduces its own type for Unicode string with handy methods to work
with. It allows to find character boundaries, grapheme clusters, character
offsets in UTF-8/UTF-16 encoding, etc.

[Matreshka library](https://alire.ada.dev/crates/matreshka_league) allows
you to operate with strings in terms of Unicode "code points", has a set of
transcoders to different encoding systems (like Windows-1251, KOI8-R),
support for JSON, XML, databases, regular expressions, XML template engine,
etc.

## Conclusions

 * Always set the compiler switch `-gnatW8`, it is a good idea to have the
   switch `-W8` for gnatbind also.
 * Configure the development environment to work in UTF-8.
 * Look at the VSS and Matreshka libraries, they make working in Unicode painless.

## Afterword

I've [proposed to add](https://github.com/alire-project/alire/issues/919)
`-gnatW8` option to projects generated by alire, but the proposal was rejected
with the reason:

> After some further discussion, the risk of introducing incompatibilities
> is too high to make this the default switch.

I don't understand what incompatibility could araise. I've tried to
compile

```ada
package Pkg is
   π : Integer;
end Pkg;
```

and correcteding code in "brackets encoding". There are no differences.
So we need more communication there.
